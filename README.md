## About

The **Space Manifesto** outliunes a set of principles, goals, and plans for the exploration and development of outer space. It can include a wide range of topics, such as space science, technology, policy, commercial and economic development, and international cooperation. 

https://www.zotero.org/groups/4602256/galactic


## Principles

1.	**Exploration:** \
We will explore and chart the vast expanse of space, seeking out new worlds and discovering the mysteries of the universe.
We will actively seek out new opportunities for exploration and discovery in the vast expanse of space.

2.	**Cooperation:** 
We will work together as a global community, pooling our resources and knowledge to achieve common goals.

3.	**Sustainability:** We will use sustainable and environmentally friendly technologies to minimize our impact on the cosmos.
4.	**Innovation:** We will push the boundaries of science and technology, developing new and revolutionary ways to travel, live, and thrive in space.
5.	**Education:** We will educate future generations about the wonders of space and inspire them to take part in humanity's journey into the stars.
6.	**Peace:** We will use our shared passion for space exploration to bring people together and promote peace and understanding between nations and cultures.
7.	**Survival:** We will ensure the survival and prosperity of our species by establishing permanent settlements on other planets, as a hedge against the eventual extinction of humanity on Earth.
8.	**Ethics:** We will respect the potential for other forms of intelligent life, and consider the ethical implications of our actions in space.
9.	**Openness:** We will promote open access to the data and knowledge gained through space exploration and encourage the participation of people from all backgrounds.
10.	**Progress:** We will strive to make steady progress in our understanding and mastery of space, while being mindful of the potential risks and benefits of our actions.


## Authors

__The Space Manifesto is an open source publicatiojn by the [Galactic Embassy](https://www.galacticembassy.com/)__

**The [Galactic Embassy](https://www.galacticembassy.com/) is Earth's envoy to the galaxy. We are on a mission to set the conditions for humanity as a Multi-Planetary Species.**

A galactic embassy is a hypothetical diplomatic facility that would be used to communicate and negotiate with extraterrestrial civilizations. It would likely be staffed by representatives from multiple Earth nations and other organizations, and would be equipped with advanced technology for communicating with alien species. The specific design and purpose of a galactic embassy would likely vary depending on the type of alien civilization it was intended to communicate with.

A galactic embassy is a hypothetical concept for a facility or organization that serves as a central point of contact and communication between different intelligent alien species in the galaxy. It would likely be staffed by representatives of various extraterrestrial civilizations and would be responsible for facilitating communication and cooperation between different worlds. This could include diplomatic negotiations, trade agreements, and the exchange of scientific and technological knowledge. The design and location of a galactic embassy would depend on the specific needs and capabilities of the various alien species involved.
