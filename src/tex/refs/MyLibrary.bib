  abstract = {The number of freeform buildings has been continuously increasing, serving as a landmark representing a country or a city. However, most of the freeform buildings have been built with conventional construction methods and required a tremendous amount of construction cost. This study seeks to apply additive manufacturing technologies to the freeform concrete formwork. Among many additive manufacturing techniques, the study focuses on the Laminated Object Manufacturing (LOM) method because of its advantages on building speed and cost. Also, the LOM technique is modified by using sloped angle at the side surface of the laminated layer (called Sloped-LOM or S-LOM), which yields great increase in the accuracy. We built a new FreeForm Formwork 3D Printer (named F3D printer) using the new approach. The F3D printer consists of a 5-axis laser cutting device for sloped cutting of EPS (Expanded Poly-Styrene) sheets with high speed, an auto pallet changer for EPS feeding, and a palletizer for EPS loading. This paper introduces the S-LOM method and the F3D printer, and the comparisons of the outputs from the conventional method and S-LOM method through actual formwork production.},

In extension, optimization procedures for skeletal structures such as trusses and frames are implemented. The developed procedures allow for the exploration of new territories in optimization of architectural structures, and offer new methodological strategies for bridging conceptual gaps between optimization and architectural practice.},

  abstract = {Geopolymer cement is the result of reaction of two materials containing aluminosilicate and concentrated alkaline solution to produce an inorganic polymer binder. The alkali solutions are corrosive and often viscous solutions which are not user friendly, and would be difficult to use for bulk production. This work aims to produce one-mix geopolymer mixed water that could be an alternative to Portland cement by blending with dry activator. Sodium hydroxide (SH) was dissolved in water and added to calcium carbonate (CC) then dried at 80°C for 8h followed by pulverization to a fixed particle size to produce the dry activator consisting of calcium hydroxide (CH), sodium carbonate (SC) and pirssonite (P). This increases their commercial availability. The dry activator was blended with granulated blast-furnace slag (GBFS) to produce geopolymer cement powder and by addition of water; the geopolymerization process is started. The effect of W/C and SH/CC ratio on the physico-mechanical properties of slag pastes was studied. The results showed that the optimum percent of activator and CC content is 4\% SH and 5\% CC, by the weight of slag, which give the highest physico-mechanical properties of GBFS. The characterization of the activated slag pastes was carried out using TGA, DTG, IR spectroscopy and SEM techniques.},

For this a common process model is used to estimate the process force in a high compliant serial robot structure. Based on experimental results the validity of the process model due to the high compliance is investigated.},

  abstract = {Today industrial companies are still trying to optimize in terms of time and cost the re-manufacturing of mechanical components. They need to directly define a new process planning from 3D information (points cloud, drawings…). This paper proposes an approach called Reverse Engineering For Manufacturing (REFM) which allows to directly obtain a CAPP (Computer Aided Process Planning) model from 3D and knowledge information. Routine tasks will also be taken into account. In this paper, RE is considered as a specific domain and concerns parts where no information is available on them. The system management is based on Design For Manufacturing (DFM) approach and enables to manage manufacturing information (the number of fixtures, the kind of milling operations...). Additionally, the future REFM system will have to propose alternatives for CAPP models. Therefore the main innovative point of REFM is to develop “manufacturing knowledge extraction” phase which is the aim of this paper.},

Studies assessing the sustainability benefits of 3DCP have not included its impact on social sustainability, nor how construction firms' implementation of this new technology has affected its success. This study applies grounded theory methods to analyze the tradeoffs between environmental, economic, and social sustainability, and how firms' decisions impact these tradeoffs. We gather insights from 20 interviews with 3DCP pioneers in Central and Northern Europe. Our findings suggest that firms' greatest incentive to invest in the technology is not related to the environmental benefits, but rather 3DCP's potential to increase automation and combat the current shortage of skilled labor in the construction sector. Current government procurement rules do not reward sustainability benefits sufficiently to encourage the uptake of 3DCP. Based on our findings, we identify five strategic decisions that companies make which affect 3DCP's sustainability, and discuss opportunities for government to foster the adoption of this technology.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present novel techniques and tools for mobile robotic in situ fabrication of fibre reinforced granular structures outdoors. The research focuses on Jammed Architectural Structures (JAS), a material system that combines granular jamming with strategically placed reinforcement creating robust yet fully reversible structures from crushed rock and string. An architectural implementation of robotic fabrication of JAS requires research on the material system to optimize fabrication speed and on the robotic fabrication method to adapt it for mobile robotic fabrication on uneven ground. There is also a need for building strategies to protect the structure from weathering and making it safe for the public. A novel robotic fabrication method with a fabrication speed that is acceptable for experimental construction and enables fabrication of building-scale dimensions on uneven ground is presented. The presented research consists of three experiments: a column built with a novel reinforcement pattern, a wall element built with a novel end-effector and a building that incorporates the findings from the two first experiments built in situ outdoors with a mobile robot. The conclusion is that robotic fabrication of JAS is suitable for outdoor constructions, that it can be used to create enclosed space that is geometrically articulated and allows for openings and that it is suitable for structural and load-bearing elements. Finally, future work on how to increase the lifespan of the material system and how to increase the fabrication speed further is outlined and discussed.},

  abstract = {The research presented herein brings forward the robotic aggregation of low-grade building material into load-bearing architectural structures that are re-usable and re-configurable with high geometrical flexibility and minimal material waste. It focuses on the physical phenomena of jamming, by which granular matter can yield and flow or jam and solidify depending on its confinement, which can be used to create architectural structures. A novel material system is identified that combines construction aggregates with tensile reinforcement. Subsequently, the constraints of this material system are analysed to explore the design space of Jammed Architectural Structures. Finally, an appropriate construction system is developed based on robotic fabrication and computational design.   The research identifies a series of fabrication methods, Rock Printing, to shape and realize load bearing jammed structures are developed. A set of building experiments validate the approach for building and construction applications. The experiments resulted in a four-legged column, showcasing the material systems geometrical flexibility, a freestanding wall element, exploiting the ability to build without formwork and a full-scale pavilion, demonstrating the potential for architectural applications. This thesis brings forward a new perspective on how aggregating building materials can be used to form architectural structures through a robotic fabrication process, for which the materials can be locally sourced and ultimately returned to their original state.},

It investigates the use of AM for producing building components with highly detailed and complex geometry, reducing material use and facilitating the integration of technical infrastructure. In order to achieve this, the concept of stay-in-place 3D printed formwork is introduced. AM is employed to produce sandstone formworks for casting concrete in any shape, regardless of geometric complexity. This approach explores the synergy between the geometric flexibility of 3D printing sand formworks and the structural capacity of concrete. It allows the production of composite components with properties superior to either individual material. This new fabrication method is demonstrated and evaluated with two large-scale 1:1 ceiling slab prototypes, which are described in this paper.},

  abstract = {The rapid development of additive manufacturing of cementitious materials has enabled the emergence of a new design paradigm, namely functional grading of material properties by location. Target performance parameters could be material weight and insulation value or (particularly important) ductility. A generic concept to achieve this, is through the selective addition of fibres or aggregates. In 3D concrete printing (3DCP), this concept can be developed into two strategies: by adding particles (i) to the bulk mixture through a second stage mixing process at the printer head (Simultaneous Process, SP), or (ii) in between the layers of deposited cementitious filament (Repetitive Sequential Process, RSP). The present paper presents the development of specific equipment required to obtain on–demand functional grading of the printed material. Subsequently, the application of these systems in print trials is shown. The current study focussed on ductility by creating fibre–reinforced 3D printed concrete through both strategies. The mechanical performance of the obtained material has been established through compressive, flexural, and crack–mouth opening displacement tests. To underline the generic nature of the strategies, a trial with lightweight aggregates has also been performed. It was shown that particularly the SP is capable of achieving improvements in ductility and self–weight.},

  abstract = {One-way steel reinforced pumice lightweight concrete slabs with bamboo permanent formwork to support building structure system are discussed. This paper aims to study the behavior and strength resistant of the slabs under flexural loading test. Eleven slab specimen divided into four groups namely BSN, BSL, BSM and BSH were considered. The slabs cross section was 550 x 120 mm with steel reinforcement ratio of 0\% (BSN), 0.39\% (BSL), 0.48\% (BSM) and 0.77\% (BSH). The slabs of 2.7 m length were supported at 2.5 m clear span. BSN was used as control specimen. The slabs were tested under two symmetrical point load acting on 1/3 clear span. The results showed that the first cracking load of BSH, BSM and BSL were generally higher than that of BSN. The present of steel reinforcement in the bamboo slab proportionally increased the slab capacities. Normalized ultimate load of BSL, BSM and BSH to BSN were 2.27, 2.64 and 4.04 respectively, where the average ultimate load capacity of BSN was 15.575 kN. Service load to ultimate load ratio of the slab with steel reinforcement were obtained varies between 0.37 and 0.57. Increasing the number of reinforcement ratio, it was found to decrease the slab ductility. The ductility index of BSL, BSM and BSH were 2.84, 2.09 and 1.34 respectively while BSN ductility index was 1.71. The effect of additional lateral reinforcement in the slab increased the slab ductility of 3.85, 2.15 and 1.56 for BSL, BSM and BSH respectively.},

  abstract = {Earth has been used as a construction material for thousands of years due to its several advantages such as low-cost, local material, recyclable, resistance to fire, and providing good thermal and acoustic insulation. Many earth-building techniques exist; rammed earth is one of the most remarkable applied methods for traditional and modern earth architecture. Selecting suitable soil is one of the major concerns for the rammed earth application method. Also, choosing and preparing the proper raw material is an important issue for good rammed earth performance [1]. Most naturally occurring soils may lack the strength, dimensional stability, density, and durability required for building construction. To obtain a good performance, moderate compressive strength, the earth is stabilized with several additives such as lime, gypsum, cement, fibers, etc. Lime stabilization [2,3] and gypsum stabilization [4] are offered as an ideal methods for earth stabilization in previous researches. The lime reacts with clay in the earth and forms calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) and calcite crystals as it becomes carbonated over time. Gypsum decreases the setting time values and enhances early age strength. When gypsum and lime are incorporated into the mixture, it is enabled to get stiffening in a short period, about 20 min, giving rigidity to material and preventing shrinkage [5]. Many studies focus on applying two different stabilization techniques: using physical stabilizers such as straw or fibers and physicochemical stabilizers such as lime and gypsum. Studies on earth material such as adobe, generally, straw is used as a traditional method to compensate shrinkage and increase its tensile strength. In addition to the straw, other waste plants can also be used in earth stabilization to improve physical and thermal properties. Crops like sunflower stem [6] beetroots [7] and flax shive [8] are used as vegetable wastes in concrete production. Plant stems can improve thermal characteristics and decrease the density due to their high porosity and low density. This study aims to produce different rammed earth mixes using locally available earth and producing a suitable construction material. The effects of incorporation of waste plant additives on the compressive strength and physical properties of rammed earth mixes are determined. These plant additives are regarded as physical stabilizers; in addition, lime and gypsum incorporated rammed earth mixes are produced and evaluated.},

Water is the worst enemy of raw earth buildings. To make it water resistant and durable, different stabilizers are added to the clay in building construction. Cement, lime, bitumen, fibers (natural and synthetic) and certain other chemicals are used worldwide. This research is aimed at finding desirable and effective means of construction material, which is economical as well as easy to handle. For this purpose, protecting earth buildings from the ill effects of rain and flood, cement, lime, gypsum and natural straw from wheat (all in different combinations) were used as stabilizers in this study. The samples produced were subjected to two different nonstandard and relativity based tests in order to examine the durability of the materials used under rain and flood. The samples were also tested under compression and tension and the results obtained were compared with the published data. From the test results analysis and comparison, it was found that using 4\% cement with 1\% straw would show excellent results for construction in rain and flood prone areas and appeared economical as well. Therefore if a house is constructed with this combination of stabilizers in rainy and flood prone area, will be more resistant to weather and would be economical as well.},

The study uses a standard Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method, from cradle to site, to assess the environmental impacts of the construction materials and processes, with a focus on load-bearing walls in small/medium size houses. As expected, cob-based methods (conventional followed by 3DP) show lower overall environmental impacts and global warming potentials than the concrete-based methods. The study also shows that while the overall environmental impacts of 3DP concrete is higher than that of 3DP cob due to higher global warming potential, stratospheric ozone depletion and fine particulate matter formation, it has less impact on marine eutrophication, land use, and mineral resources scarcity. The environmental issues that remain to be overcome in relation to 3DP concrete is its high-cement content, while the issue in 3DP cob rises from the use of electricity for the 3D printing operation. The study indicates that the use of renewable energy resources and innovative material science can greatly increase the potentials of both 3DP cob and 3DP concrete respectively for future construction.},

  abstract = {This thesis explores Non-Standard Architecture, a movement in Postmodern architecture on non-Euclidean parametric and algorithmic formalism, and suggests a series of inherent limits prevented its full realisation. The thesis answers how these limits might be overcome by formulating the Third Digital Turn of Non-Standard. The Third Digital Turn emerged from the Second Digital Turn, an architectural movement from 2012 that realised parametric architecture through novel methods of form finding and construction using parametric data models and robotics. Through the Third Digital Turn the thesis formulates the Statutes of Non-Standard Architecture that describe the process of legislation in terms of the invention of new practice for Non-Standard Architecture.   The thesis traces the evolution of the Second Digital Turn through novel interpretations of geometric lineage across architectural epochs, and identifies parametrisation with the codified law of architecture beginning in the Renaissance. The thesis identifies a gap between the possibilities of digital technologies in architecture and the current capacities of the building industry to realise them. Persistent challenges to achieving these objectives of automation are the limits of the regulatory environment and conservative construction practices. The thesis argues that such inherent limits can be overcome by reconsidering the existing regulations that frame technology and by implementing a methodology for ecological governance in architecture.   The thesis contributes to the field in two key areas. First, it evolves Non-Standard architectural codification and production processes to extend the capacity of existing skills and technologies. Second, it indicates opportunities for environmental sustainability with protocols for Non-Standard design and construction, functional grading of material and automation in architecture.},

  abstract = {Exotic materials such as titanium offer superior characteristics that, paradoxically, make them hard-to-cut by conventional machining. As a solution, electric discharge machining (EDM) stands out as a non-conventional process able to cut complex profiles from hard-to-cut materials, delivering dimensional accuracy and a superior surface. However, EDM is embodied in CNC machines with a reduced axis and machining envelope, which constrains design freedom in terms of size and shape. To overcome these CNC constraints, traditional machining using six-axis industrial robots have become a prominent research field, and some applications have achieved cost efficiency, an improved envelope, and high flexibility. However, due to the lack of stiffness and strength of the robot arm, accuracy, material rate removal, and surface finishing are not comparable to CNC machining. Therefore, the present study investigates the design of a novel WEDM combined with six-axis robotic machining to overcome the limitations of traditional robotic machining and enhance EDM applications. This study extends the work of a conference paper to confirm potential outcomes, quantifying and ranking undesired interactions to map technical problems and applying the TRIZ approach to trigger solutions. Finally, an effective robotic end-effector design is proposed to free EDM from CNC and deliver robotic machining as a flexible and accurate machining system for exotic materials.},

  abstract = {Exotic materials such as hardened steel and tungsten carbide tool steel have unique resistance and properties that make them hard-to-cut. Thus, research to find better ways to process such materials requires an innovative approach and new ideas. Therefore, the present study investigates the design of a novel WDEM combined with robotic machining to overcome limitations of traditional robotic machining. Wire EDM (WEDM) stands out as a non-traditional machining process able to cut complex profiles of hard-to-cut materials, achieving high dimensional accuracy and superior surface finishing. Unfortunately, WEDM is designed in rigid bed-based CNC machines which restrict design freedom in terms of size, shape and features due to machining envelope constraint. On the other hand, traditional machining processes such as drilling and milling using six-axis industrial robots have been investigated and some applications have successfully delivered cost efficiency, improved envelope and high flexibility. However, due to the structure and strength of the robot arm, accuracy, repeatability and finishing are not comparable to CNC machining outcomes. These researches are also restricted by the power of the robot arm holding the machining tool. This paper explores, identifies and selects suitable configurations and define research actions that must be taken to achieve a highly flexible, accurate machining system for exotic materials.},

The history of making in interior design is aligned with traditional crafts, but a parallel discourse with digital fabrication has yet to be made evident. This book repositions the praxis of experimental prototyping and integrated technology to show how the use of digital fabrication is inherent to the interior scales of body, objects and enclosure. These three scales act as a central theme to frame contributions that reinforce the interdisciplinary nature of interior design and reinterpret traditional crafts by integrating new methods of making into conventional workflows. Featuring significant international practitioners and researchers, the selected contributions represent the ever-increasing interdisciplinary nature of design, demonstrating a breadth of disciplines.

To this end, DMR is demonstrated in the DMR Interface, an Android app, which accepts semantic vocal commands as well as containing a GUI for feedback and verification. This app is combined with a robot-mounted 3D camera to enable robotic interaction with the surroundings or compensate for unpredictable environments. This combination of tools gives users access to adaptive automation whereby a robot is no longer given explicit instructions but instead is given a job to do and will adapt its movements to execute this regardless of any slight changes to the goal or environment. The major advantages of this system come in the vagueness of the instructions given and a constant feedback of task accomplishment, approaching the manner in which we subconsciously control our bodies or would guide another person to achieve a goal.},

The aim is to bring the practice of building ceramic structures close to the contemporary production context by proposing a revision of a well-established production method – clay extrusion – and informing it with deep computational design and robotic fabrication techniques. Method The envisioned industrial scenario is emulated by fabricating a series of ceramic prototypes through the use of a 6-axis robotic arm equipped with a wire-cutting tool, developing ruled-shaped interlocking clay units for the creation of innovative loadbearing walls. A systematic workflow allows for the direct stream of information from a parametrically-discretized input surface to the generation of cutting paths for shaping clay bodies through the robot. Results \& Discussion The combination of high-tech computational design and robotic fabrication processes with low-tech onsite assembly allows for the generation of serialized mass-customized ruled-geometry ceramic units for hybrid structures, such as doubly-curved loading-bearing walls with enhanced structural performances. The result is a fast, economic, and efficient way to fabricate highly differentiated ceramic components with the use of robotic technologies.},

Global production of cement has grown very rapidly in recent years, and after fossil fuels and land-use change, it is the third-largest source of anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide. The availability of the required data for estimating emissions from global cement production is poor, and it has been recognised that some global estimates are significantly inflated. Here we assemble a large variety of available datasets, prioritising official data and emission factors, including estimates submitted to the UNFCCC plus new estimates for China and India, to present a new analysis of global process emissions from cement production. We show that global process emissions in 2017 were 1.48±0.20\,Gt\,CO2, equivalent to about 4\,\% of emissions from fossil fuels. Cumulative emissions from 1928 to 2017 were 36.9±2.3\,Gt\,CO2, 70\,\% of which have occurred since 1990. Emissions in 2016 were 28\,\% lower than those recently reported by the Global Carbon Project.

Such stairs are composite masonry structures formed by a two or three layers of tiles disposed in a herringbone-pattern. The analysis is based on the assumption that the material is unilateral, namely a No-Tension material in the sense of Heyman; in particular the safe theorem of Limit Analysis is employed. In the spirit of the safe theorem the structure is stable if a statically admissible stress field can be constructed; for the unilateral material here employed, singular stress fields, that is stress concentrated on surfaces (membranes) or lines (arches) are allowed. The statically admissible stress fields that are constructed, combining membrane stresses and 3d diffuse uniaxial stresses, are purely compressive and balance transverse loads either uniformly distributed or localized. A simple order-of-magnitude calculation confirm that bending and torsion resistance is small compared to the structural demand, and that a purely compressive membrane equilibrium stress field is required; the level of compressive stresses required to balance the load is below the limit compressive threshold.},

Thus, an analysis of the performance of the materials that make up the final product was carried out, such as the binders that act as chemical stabilizers and the different types of soils, also the mechanical resistance and durability tests and finally the technical standards for its manufacturing. For this aim, a literature review was carried out in three electronic databases, Scopus, Web of Science and Scielo. The results showed environmental concerns with the use of Portland cement for stabilization, therefore, 18\% of the studies used agricultural residues and 25\% used mineral by-products, for partial or total replacement of Portland cement. Soils with plasticity indexes between 15\% and 30\% have a stabilization success rate of 69\%, while soils with plasticity index less than 15\% have a stabilization greater than 93\%, which can be increased to 100\% if the soil have a percentage of clay and silt between 21 and 35\%. On the other hand, a plasticity index above 30\% negatively affects stabilization. The compaction energy applied in the manufacture of CEB is an important parameter, as it influences the density, thermal conductivity and mechanical strength. Among the sustainable construction techniques, CEB is a great option, as it can be done locally and with ease of construction.},

  abstract = {The overall aim of this dissertation is to increase awareness of the potential of BIM for heritage conservation in academic studios and professional practice. This dissertation investigates the current state of knowledge on BIM in an extensive literature review in chapter 2, which establishes the theoretical and technical foundations of the field and looks at existing knowledge from both the new-build and conservation sectors. The literature review highlights the need for more dedicated research on the practical aspects of BIM for heritage and suggests practical research as a method for further investigation.  Following the literature review, chapter 3 examines creative practice methodologies employed in academic research at postgraduate and doctoral levels in the UK and abroad. This review of existing methodologies was used as a basis for developing the research methodology of this dissertation, in accordance with the third research objective.  Chapter 4 presents the core module of the research methodology, referred to as ‘practicum’, which involved situated practical work under professional studio conditions in Summerhall, Edinburgh. In this chapter, following a justification of the research methodology employed for this dissertation, the results of practice are presented, including the BIM strategies developed in response to project conditions and goals, as well as an overview of practical work. In the end, these results are evaluated in relation to the wider theoretical and technical context provided by the literature review.  The last chapter presents a discussion as to the success of the research methodology in relation to the particular research question, aim, and objectives. BIM for heritage conservation is a relatively new field of research and presents many opportunities for future investigation. In response to the research question, the dissertation concludes with a justification for the following argument: although BIM philosophy is ideally suitable for heritage purposes, BIM adoption in conservation practice is hindered by the current limitations of BIM software.},

The successful integration of existing reinforcement systems, such as steel rebar, rods, wires, fibres or filaments, will indeed allow for printed concrete structures to be designed using standard structural codes. However, reinforcement integration has to be compatible with either the specific printing technique adopted for the structural element production or with its shape. This paper provides a systematic overview of a number of digital fabrication techniques using reinforced concrete that have been developed so far, proposing a possible organization by structural principle, or place in the manufacturing process.},

  abstract = {Development of earthen building materials is one of the answers that the construction sector can provide to tackle the accelerated climate change issue. However, these materials present a wide variability, even at the local scale, and their water durability can be difficult to ensure. In order to improve their durability regarding water and avoid its prejudicial effect on earthen material’s properties, the stabilisation with bio-polymers is an increasingly studied solution. In this paper a ten-minute erosion drip test is developed and performed for various combinations of Breton earths and bio-based additions or surface treatments (linseed oil, xanthan gum, casein, alginate, vegetal varnish and tannins). The final pitting depths and eroded volumes are compared and the evolution of erosion during the test is monitored. These results are also linked to previously obtained water capillary absorption coefficients. The obtained results enable to highlight the impact of bio-based additions on erodibility of earthen materials: linseed oil and xanthan gum help to protect the earth-based samples from erosion. Other original parameters characterizing the erosion of the samples during the drip test are suggested. Limitations of this type of erosion tests are also brought out.},

However, an up to date review of the rationalization strategies used in these projects, their place in the design sequence and their relation to digital fabrication processes has not been conducted. The purpose of this review is to identify the rationalization strategies used in architectural projects in the practice and the academia. This paper presents the results of a systematic review of over 500 papers describing rationalization and digital fabrication in contemporary architecture. Using the data gathered in the review, we show that the capabilities of the fabrication machinery used are the most frequently encountered rationalization constraint in realized architectural projects. Additionally, we describe a new taxonomy for rationalization strategies, which incorporates functional information with the temporal information described by traditional classifications. Using this taxonomy, we identify trends within the industry and the academia and point to the growing popularity of parametric co-rationalization approaches. We conclude by discussing promising rationalization approaches for future research.},

The suggested method predicts the feasibility, material use, and machining time required for fabricating the moulds for these geometries. It achieves this by interrogating geometric properties instead of the traditional machining simulations. Using the algorithms developed in this research, the method can provide real time evaluation of computer-controlled mould fabrication techniques such as cutting and assembling sheet materials, multi-axis milling of volumetric material, and robotic hot wire cutting. In the paper, we describe the mathematical basis of the suggested method. We demonstrate how the method provides real-time visual feedback for designers and allows them to adjust their design according to fabrication constraints in the early design stages. Using architectural case studies, we show how the analysis results provide precise cost estimates and help minimize fabrication resources in manual or automatic fabrication optimization processes.},

In contrast to existing 3DCP approaches, which often stack material vertically, the SCRIM approach permits full exploitation of 6-axis robotic control by utilising supportive meshes to define 3D surfaces onto which concrete is selectively deposited at various orientation angles. Also, instead of fully encapsulating the textile in a cementitious matrix using formworks or spraying concrete, SCRIM relies on sparsely depositing concrete to achieve structural, tectonic and aesthetic design goals, minimising material use. The motivation behind this novel concept is to fully engage the 3D control capabilities of conventional robotics in concrete use, offering an enriched spatial potential extending beyond extruded geometries prevalent in 3DCP, and diversifying the existing spectrum of digital construction approaches. The SCRIM concept is demonstrated through a small-scale proof-of-concept and a larger-scale experiment, described in this paper. Based on the results, we draw a critical review on the limitations and potentials of the approach.},

  abstract = {The paper proposes an analytical homogenization procedure to predict the overall elastic properties of shotearth, a sustainable composite material made of excavated soil, aggregates and, if needed, a binder for stabilization. A multi-step methodology based on the Mori–Tanaka approach is used to account for the stabilized soil inclusions. This approach is proposed in order to shorten the mix-design procedures and readily provide to the structural engineers a set of mechanical properties of the shot-earth components to be used in the early design phases, when the construction field is not open yet and excavation of the site has not begun. The analytical results were successfully validated through an experimental campaign.},

With the construction industry gradually entering the era of industrialization and digitization, there is an opportunity to increasingly change the traditional approach of designing, constructing, operating, and maintaining buildings and infrastructure. The era of technological disruption ushers in the penetration of innovative construction tools, including automation and robotics technologies, in the industry. In construction, automation and robotics processes involve the autonomous execution of tasks and processes through intelligent programming and control of machines. This chapter explores the current state of automation and robotics technologies deployment in the construction industry and discusses potential automation and robotics applications in different aspects of construction projects. Construction companies can use these technologies to benchmark their technology adoption efforts.},

The robot should be programmed quickly and efficiently with the off-line robot programming (OLP) method. In this paper, an OLP system based on Python and OpenCasCade libraries is introduced to generate robot trajectories for cleaning the printer powder bed immediately and autonomously. The cleaning operation is divided into three sub-operations: top layer raster, raster from the offset, and offset oriented. Several algorithms are employed to satisfy sub-operations autonomously from a CAD model. Raster path, wire, and yaw angle calculators are essential algorithms. Finally, a graphical simulation illustrates the operation efficiency. The proposed system can generate a cleaning path immediately and due to utilizing open resource libraries, there is a wide range of applicable personalization.},

  abstract = {The construction industry is being buffeted by winds of change, balancing the urgent need to remedy deteriorating infrastructure in the developed world and the push to build new infrastructure in emerging economies whilst devising means to better its catastrophic carbon footprint. Much of the deleterious environmental impact of construction derives from the utilization of concrete as well as inefficiencies across the construction process that result in considerable waste and energy expenditure. Additive manufacturing methods stand poised to substantially transform the industry by enhancing automation, enabling economy of materials use, and allowing for unprecedented fusion of form and function; however, reliance on concrete as the extrusive material of choice has the potential to greatly compound mounting environmental challenges. In this perspective, we discuss our efforts to develop an altogether new palette of naturally sourced construction materials based on natural soils, which are reconfigured into extrudable formulations compatible with additive manufacturing. We furthermore delineate a roadmap bringing together soil chemistry with composite science, modeling of mesoscale phenomena, rheological studies of extrudable soil “inks,” generative design, and the development of robust structure—function correlations relating atomistic and mesoscale structures as well as geometry of the architectures to load-bearing capabilities and mechanical response. We illustrate this approach using a naturally harvested burlewash clay sample crosslinked through formation of a siloxane framework, which has been 3D printed into a load-bearing structure. The need for an integrated life cycle assessment approach is emphasized to ensure development of a new palette of sustainable construction materials.},

  abstract = {This article discusses how contemporary architects reinterpret traditional craft practices such as ironwork, woodwork, stonework, knitting, lacework, and paper craft in their building designs. It explores the Polish Expo Pavilion in Shanghai (2010) and Nottingham Contemporary (2009) in terms of digital design and manufacturing technology. In both buildings, the architects simulate the craftwork of paperwork and lacework on the façades of their buildings. Through the virtuosic use of CAD (computer-aided design) and CAM (computer-aided manufacturing), they expand the field of contemporary ornament by reintroducing traditional craftwork. The study argues that digital technology contributes to contemporary architecture as a tool for restoring traditions of craftwork, as much as an innovative medium for rendering images and presenting architecture. Simulating craftwork or reinterpreting handicrafts at the scale of a whole building positions history in a contemporary context. Renouncing Adolf Loos’ remark on ornament as wasted labor and time, the digitally fabricated ornament is produced effortlessly, requiring little human labor. Yet, the worker’s natural irregularity, or “maker’s stamp” in John Ruskin’s terms, are missing from these digital fabrications: there is no defect, or trace of an architect’s presence in digital craftwork. Being devoid of such criteria that usually characterize craft, the paper states that mastery is redefined in the age of advanced digital technology and probes the current emphasis given to the digital image and its surface effects.},

Focusing on the period surrounding World War II-before fossil-fuel powered air-conditioning became widely available-Daniel Barber brings to light a vibrant and dynamic architectural discussion involving design, materials, and shading systems as means of interior climate control. He looks at projects by well-known architects such as Richard Neutra, Le Corbusier, Lúcio Costa, Mies van der Rohe, and Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill, and the work of climate-focused architects such as MMM Roberto, Olgyay and Olgyay, and Cliff May. Drawing on the editorial projects of James Marston Fitch, Elizabeth Gordon, and others, he demonstrates how images and diagrams produced by architects helped conceptualize climate knowledge, alongside the work of meteorologists, physicists, engineers, and social scientists. Barber describes how this novel type of environmental media catalyzed new ways of thinking about climate and architectural design. Extensively illustrated with archival material, Modern Architecture and Climate provides global perspectives on modern architecture and its evolving relationship with a changing climate, showcasing designs from Latin America, Europe, the United States, the Middle East, and Africa. This timely and important book reconciles the cultural dynamism of architecture with the material realities of ever-increasing carbon emissions from the mechanical cooling systems of buildings, and offers a historical foundation for today's zero-carbon design"--},

  abstract = {This paper focuses on describing a novel hybrid concrete printing/casting process we term Profile-3D-Printing. Profile3D-Printing is an additive/subtractive manufacturing process that combines deposition of concrete for rough layup with precision tooling for surface finishing of architectural building components commonly found in the architectural precast industry. Our research team from Architecture, the Robotics Institute, and Material Science invented this novel hybrid manufacturing process for robotically printing architectural facade panels with complex surface geometries. This effort was motivated by previously validated research focused on calibrating the thermal exchange rate of vertical surface geometries for the purpose of improving both the esthetic and thermodynamic performance of passive heating and cooling systems in buildings. Our hybrid approach to concrete 3D printing is unique because it combines high-volume material deposition, multi-resolution surface finishing, and the ability for high customization without significant increases in production time. Our project will significantly advance systems integration between energy-based building performance design and advance additive manufacturing, enabling precast concrete suppliers to design and manufacture innovative architectural products with added value for end users in energy savings. This project serves as a template for other industries to adopt hybrid additive manufacturing systems to transform traditionally mold-based approaches. The goal of our project is to develop and test robotic 3D-printing systems that enable customization for high-resolution parts. Hybrid additive manufacturing (Hybrid-AM) enables automated tooling of soft and phase-changing materials to achieve fine feature resolution and finish quality independent of print nozzle size. Currently, speed of printing, control of finish quality, and flexibility of application are three of the most significant barriers for industries seeking to adopt additive manufacturing for part production. This project highlights how Hybrid-AM techniques, built on robotic work cells, address these challenges to enable customization of value-added products.},

  abstract = {We are interested in interactive agents that learn to coordinate, namely, a \$builder\$ -- which performs actions but ignores the goal of the task -- and an \$architect\$ which guides the builder towards the goal of the task. We define and explore a formal setting where artificial agents are equipped with mechanisms that allow them to simultaneously learn a task while at the same time evolving a shared communication protocol. The field of Experimental Semiotics has shown the extent of human proficiency at learning from a priori unknown instructions meanings. Therefore, we take inspiration from it and present the Architect-Builder Problem (ABP): an asymmetrical setting in which an architect must learn to guide a builder towards constructing a specific structure. The architect knows the target structure but cannot act in the environment and can only send arbitrary messages to the builder. The builder on the other hand can act in the environment but has no knowledge about the task at hand and must learn to solve it relying only on the messages sent by the architect. Crucially, the meaning of messages is initially not defined nor shared between the agents but must be negotiated throughout learning. Under these constraints, we propose Architect-Builder Iterated Guiding (ABIG), a solution to the Architect-Builder Problem where the architect leverages a learned model of the builder to guide it while the builder uses self-imitation learning to reinforce its guided behavior. We analyze the key learning mechanisms of ABIG and test it in a 2-dimensional instantiation of the ABP where tasks involve grasping cubes, placing them at a given location, or building various shapes. In this environment, ABIG results in a low-level, high-frequency, guiding communication protocol that not only enables an architect-builder pair to solve the task at hand, but that can also generalize to unseen tasks.},

  abstract = {The inevitable expansion of the built environment due to the rapid growth of the urban population in emerging contexts poses a great challenge for the sustainable development of local communities. This problem could be faced by providing adequate multistorey building solutions while using sustainable and eco-friendly materials, preferably from renewable or upcycled and locally available sources. These materials tend to have lower mechanical properties than those commonly used in conventional structures and therefore not adequate for elements subjected to bending such as floor slabs. This challenge can be met by improving the strength of the locally available materials and/or using geometries specifically designed to lower the structural stresses such as funicular structures. In this study, a novel clay-based cementless material is used. Different mixtures and additives were tested to achieve similar processing advantages as concrete. A parabolic arched floor element is designed based on a parametric analysis using graphic statics to reduce structural stresses and weight. The fabrication system is based on reusable formworks in which locally available earth is used as part of the mould. A four meters span arched floor is built to analyse its structural behaviour and to evaluate the proposed fabrication method.},

Engineered systems, however, are typically quite brittle, making design automation extremely difficult. We propose to address this problem with a generative representation of design based on manifold operators. The operator set we propose combines the intuitive simplicity of top-down rewrite rules with the flexibility and distortion tolerance of bottom-up GRN-based models. An embryogeny specified using this representation thus places constraints on a developing design, rather than specifying a fixed body plan, allowing canalization processes to modulate the design as it continues to develop. We demonstrate our ideas in the domain of electromechanical design and validate them with simulations at different levels of abstraction.},

In natural biological organisms, the processes of morphogenesis adapt structure to environment remarkably well on both an individual and evolutionary time scale. However, no clear framework has been developed for exploiting morphogenetic principles in the creation of engineered systems. In this paper, we present preliminary work toward such a framework, developed against the example of a robot similar to the iRobot LANdroid. We first show how developmental programs might act as a reference architecture for engineered designs, facilitating variation. We then present a candidate basis set of geometric operations for encoding adaptable developmental programs, demonstrate how they can be applied to develop a robot body plan, and discuss progress toward implementation.},

  abstract = {Heating and cooling of residential buildings consumes around ten percent of the world's energy. One approach for reducing these costs is to exploit the high thermal mass of sustainable building materials, for example rammed earth (RE), for intelligent solar passive design. However, there is a lack of scientific evidence about the thermal performance of RE houses in real-world settings. This research investigated to what extent thermal performance in unconditioned RE structures in rural Australia can be captured by current accreditation software. Two custom-designed houses were built in the hot-arid city of Kalgoorlie-Boulder, Western Australia: one comprising traditional solid cement-stabilised rammed earth walls (RE) and the other walls with an insulating polystyrene core (iRE). Otherwise the houses were identical in orientation and design. The houses were instrumented to monitor indoor temperature and humidity conditions prior to and during occupancy. Results were compared to those simulated using cutting-edge assessment software BERS Pro (v4.3) as an example of that used for energy efficiency accreditation in Australia. This first paper in this series discusses the houses’ construction and instrumentation and results obtained during the unoccupied period, i.e. those purely demonstrative of the structure's thermal performance. A second paper in the series presents data gathered during occupancy, to contrast occupant thermal comfort with that predicted numerically. Measured data showed that both houses performed nominally-identically: the houses did not receive any relative benefit from including iRE. Simulated data was also similar per house. However, measured performance did not match that simulated: simulated rooms had poorer thermal stability and lag and, consequently, exaggerated internal temperature variations. Collected data has been made publicly available for future analyses.},

  abstract = {A novel automated offline programming system (AOLP) is proposed, which integrates a flexible and intuitive OLP platform with a state-of-the-art autonomous object pose estimation method to achieve an environment and model independent platform for automatic robotic manufacturing. In manufacturing industries, offline programming (OLP) platforms provide an independent methodology for robot integration using 3D model simulation away from the actual robot cell and production process, reducing integration time and costs. However, traditional OLP platforms still require prior knowledge of the workpiece position in a predefined environment, which requires complex human operations and specific-purpose designs, highly reducing the autonomy of the systems. The presented approach proposes to overcome these problems by defining a novel automated offline programming system (AOLP), which integrates a flexible and intuitive OLP platform with a state-of-the-art autonomous object pose estimation method, to achieve an environment and model independent platform for automatic robotic manufacturing. The autonomous recognition capabilities of the three-dimensional vision system provide the relative position of the workpiece model in the OLP platform, with robustness against clutter, illumination, and object material. After that, the user-friendly OLP platform allows an efficient and automatic path generation, simulation, robot code generation, and robot execution. The proposed system precision and robustness are analyzed and validated in a real-world environment on four different sets of experiment. Finally, the proposed system’s features are discussed and compared with other available solutions for practical industrial manufacturing, showing the advantages of the proposed approach. Overall, despite sensor resolution limitations, the proposed system shows a remarkable precision and promising direction towards highly efficient and productive manufacturing solutions.},

The complex requirements associated with the robot research has given a challenge for software developers to think about the easy development process, cost effectiveness, and user-friendly environment. As a result, an offline CAD-based tool for technical computing industry is developed using a visual studio with open cascade (OCC) libraries to generate a path for robot simulation. In the present approach, OCC environment is developed to import CAD model of the robot manipulator and workpieces without the need of integrating with commercial CAD packages. In addition, the developed system provides important steps: extracting CAD information for path planning, checking the reachability of manipulators, and simulating the motion to check and avoid the possible collision before mapping to a real site. Using the extracted information, the robot manipulator can then automatically follow a path generated by the OCC geometric kernels. The path generation tool based on the OCC platform is more efficient and easier to develop for various applications. The simulation platform developed in this work can serve as an independent and valuable development tool in the intelligent automation industry.},

Consequently, the aim of this review is to define the field of foam 3DP (F3DP) in construction and provide an overview of relevant developments, challenges, and future research. Based on the analysis of more than 150 peer-reviewed articles and research reports, three major themes within the academic debate about F3DP could be identified: developments in material composition and material design, printing and processing technologies, and future challenges in application and material processing development. This review brings together promising advancements in F3DP for construction into a systematic overview and opens new horizons in research and development for sustainable construction processes.},

However, they have not been comprehensively implemented because their technical data is highly variable, and they are not fully represented in building codes. To address these hurdles, this paper presents an environmental assessment and a policy repair review, including an environmental embodied impact analysis, and a discussion of the regulatory development required for earthen construction. The results of the environmental assessment show that earthen wall assemblies significantly reduce environmental impacts by 62-99\% when compared with conventional assemblies such as timber frame and concrete blocks. Additionally, the policy discussion provides recommendations to overcoming materials variability and regulatory organizational collaboration. Overall, this paper highlights the importance of environmental and policy measures that could be used by policy makers and earthen building advocates in their endeavours to catalyse the representation of earthen building materials and methods in mainstream construction.},

  abstract = {In his much-quoted essay The Work of Art In The Age of Mechanical Reproduction, Walter Benjamin discusses that original artworks have an inherent aura and emphasizes the importance of material authenticity, arguing that mechanical reproduction leads to the loss of that auratic and iconic qualities. Within this context of the materiality argument that fails to consider the values that might emerge as a result of the digital technology of reproduction, it is difficult to redefine the digitally reconstructed object as a legitimate source of knowledge. In the face of such arguments, this study aims to demonstrate the potential for a remanifestation of authenticity in architecture through the implementation of contemporary digital technologies of reproduction. From this perspective, it is suggested that the authenticity of the architectural reproductions can be preserved along its trajectory through time and space by the redefinition of the nature of its material relations. The study argues that architectural reproductions are essential for the original to survive beyond the conditions of its material presence since all prospective architecture originates from the architectures past, and the profession of architecture as a cumulative form of knowledge relies on the making of copies. It is further discussed that as an act of inheritance itself, the act of drawing as the fundamental method of architectural reproduction and the orthographic consciousness as the preconceptual shape space of architectural design, are being reinscribed by the logic of real-time and electronic interfaces in our present era of post-orthography as heralded by John May. In order to illustrate the critical role of digital reconstruction technologies in the field of architecture, the photogrammetry method will be employed to partially reconstruct the case study buildings in a specific space and time, resulting in 3D interactive models that reveal the existent texture, color, patina, and use.},

  abstract = {Topology optimization (TO) is a numerical simulation to identify an optimal distribution of solid and void. A more efficient distribution of material means a reduction of natural resources consumption. TO results in branching structures, difficult to manufacture with conventional methods. Advances in additive manufacturing allow the production of components at an unforeseen level of complexity. The computational cost and the need for expert knowledge in setup prevent TO from being part of architects' set of instruments. Data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) improved not only classification tasks but also spawned various synthetic models. We trained a generative adversarial network (GAN) with the boundary conditions as input and the result of a conventional TO as output. We chose a wall with randomly placed openings as a case study and produced three different training sets. The GAN was able to generate an output in a fraction of a second. The network learned to output structures close to the ground truth and generalized even across data sets. We measured the accuracy of the generated results with different metrics. The accuracy of the results was very encouraging within a few percents of the target value's deviation. The significant speed improvement is a first and promising indicator of how machine learning could provide real-time feedback to the designer. Integrated into a CAD environment, dynamic updates, even for complex tasks, are invaluable in the conceptual design phase. Such an instrument can help the designer save material and most efficiently layout the building structure.},

IGES is used for representing design and topology information in a platform independent format. The failure of the IGES standard to provide information other than drawing and solid modeling has led to the emergence of a new international standard for product model data exchange (ISO 10303) called STEP. STEP is designed to support a product through its entire life cycle. The STEP standard consists of a set of application protocols. An application protocol is specific to a particular engineering domain. In this case, STEP application protocol 202 is used because it defines the constructs necessary to represent the associative draughting information described by IGES. The translator parses the IGES file and converts it into the corresponding STEP (AP202) format. To test the conformance of the generated STEP file we have written code to enable visualization of an Application Protocol 202 (AP202) STEP file. The visualization uses the Open Inventor Toolkit available for the Silicon Graphics platform. The visualizer reads the STEP (AP202) file and converts the geometry and related annotations into the corresponding Inventor specific format. The file can then be viewed using the default Inventor viewer.},

  abstract = {Feature recognition, from low level geometric entities of product design representations within a CAD model to facilitate process planning and manufacturing activities, has been of significant importance in computer integrated manufacturing (CIM). However, the emerging paradigm of Agile Manufacturing has imposed additional requirements of “neutral format” so that form-feature information can be readily shared among multiple partners of a virtual enterprise. Recently, the STandard for the Exchange of Product model data (STEP) has emerged as the means for neutral form exchange of product related data. The “STEP efforts” have broken down the domain of manufacturing related activities in the form of application protocols (APs) target for specific functions which include drafting, configuration control and feature-based process planning to mention a few. Efforts are still on to increase the acceptance and use of this international standard (IS). This paper focuses on our efforts to support the STEP standard with the development of a standards-oriented form-feature extraction system. The developed feature extraction system takes as a input a STEP file defining the geometry and topology of a part and generates as output a STEP file with form-feature information in AP224 format for form feature-based process planning. The system can also be interfaced with a recent IGES to AP202 translator [M.P. Bhandarkar, B. Downie, M. Hardwick, R. Nagi, Migration from IGES to STEP: one-to-one translation of IGES drawing to STEP drafting data, accepted by Computers in Industry, July, 1999; M.P. Bhandarkar, Satisfying information needs in Agile Manufacturing through translation and feature extraction into STEP product data models, MS Thesis, State University of New York at Buffalo, 1997.] to allow conversion of legacy data. The feature recognition algorithm is boundary-representation (B-Rep) based and follows a sequential approach through an existing classification of features. Properties of each feature class are exploited to enable their extraction. The algorithm is currently developed for prismatic solids produced by milling operations and that contain elementary shapes such as plane and cylindrical surfaces (possibly using non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS)). Special attention has been paid to implementation issues. We demonstrate the efficacy of the system using representative parts.},

  abstract = {Conventional material extrusion additive manufacturing (AM) processes require the user to make a trade-off between surface quality and build time of the part. A large bead filament deposition can speed up the build process; however, it leads to surfaces with high roughness due to the stair-stepping effect. The surface quality can be improved by using a small bead filament deposition, which increases the build time of the part. We present a new approach incorporating hybrid multi-resolution layers in material extrusion additive manufacturing to provide excellent surface quality without increasing the build time. Our slicing algorithm generates planar layers with large filaments to fill the interior regions in less time. The generated exterior layers are conformal and use small filaments to reduce the stair-stepping effect and improve surface quality. We also present a path planning algorithm to build parts with a single manipulator using a multi-nozzle extrusion tool. The path planning algorithm generates a smooth material deposition path by avoiding collision between the tool and the already built layers. It reduces the collision checks and performs collision detection in a computationally efficient manner. We build five parts to validate our approach and illustrate the benefits of multi-resolution AM.},

Then, using this programmatic perspective, we specify some example developmental processes and discuss the characteristics that make them suitable candidates for evolutionary variation and selection. Consistent with the theory of facilitated variation from evolutionary biology, we find that variation in developmental processes can be introduced and conserved due to the hierarchical organization of growth specification.},

Secondly, a novel continuous extrusion constraint is implemented to facilitate the continuous printing operation of the design. Thirdly, the anisotropy of the 3DCP process is simulated during optimization by employing a transverse isotropic material model. Fourthly, domain segmentation is introduced to facilitate modular construction, and each partitioned segment can be assigned with its favorable print direction.

The innovation of this approach lies on the definition of an iterative refinement of the shape into a set of patches that are automatically tiled and used to approximate the original shape up to a prescribed error. The coding of the patches is supported by the Reeb graph and contains the rules to properly tile, stitch them, and reconstruct the original shape while preserving its topology, using a technique which is also exploited for reconstructing an object from non-planar contours. The method is geometry-aware by definition, as the nodes of the Reeb graph are representative of the main shape features, which belong to the approximated shape already at the initial iteration steps. The points of the reconstructed shape belong to the original surface, their total number is highly reduced, and the original connectivity is replaced by a set of patches that preserves the global topology of the input shape.},

The provided tool base uses refurbished robotic technology, which is retrofitted with state-of-the-art open source control software, and by employing local approaches and available materials the dependency on imported materials and processes is drastically reduced. The D2RP unit is coupled with the electricity generating Kite Power (KP) system developed at TUD to create a mobile sustainable autarkic unit that can be deployed everywhere.

  abstract = {When concrete is sprayed during shotcreting, inevitably some material is lost due to rebound. The relative losses for coarse aggregates and fibers are higher than that for the rest, and therefore the composition of the material in-place is deficient in these phases. In order to compensate for such loss and indeed to minimize it, one must identify the parameters affecting rebound and comprehend the underlying mechanisms. Recent work has established a theory of rebound for coarse aggregates. However, fibers differ from aggregates in their material and geometric properties and the effect of these must be understood in order to extend the existing theory of rebound to fibers. This is a study on the influence of particle density upon the rebound of a projectile impinging via the dry-mix process onto fresh shotcrete. The empirical model developed in this study postulates that a lower aggregate density favors lower rebound and this prediction was verified using two kinds of lightweight aggregates in dry-mix shotcrete.},

The latter constitute an important class of geometric objects, with relations to “Lobel” meshes, and to freeform polyhedral patterns.

Thrust lines are used to visualize the forces within the masonry and to predict possible collapse modes. The models are interactive and parametric to explore relationships between building geometry and possible equilibrium conditions in real time. Collapse analysis due to applied displacements is determined by combining kinematics and statics. The approach is largely two dimensional, though more complex three-dimensional problems are analyzed using the same methods. This paper presents a series of analytical tools that are fast and easy to use in real time, but at the same time rigorous and highly accurate. This work represents a significant improvement over traditional methods of thrust line analysis performed by hand, which are often tedious and time-consuming.},

  abstract = {Novel fabrication methods are necessary to capitalize on the high strength-to-weight ratio of composites engineered for construction applications. This paper presents prefabrication strategies for geometrically-complex building elements wound out of Glass and Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymers (G/CFRP). The research focuses on Robotic Coreless Filament Winding (RCFW), a technology that eliminates formwork, proposing upscaling and industrialization strategies combined with updated robot programming and control methods. Our application addresses the prefabrication of hyperboloid, tubular components with differentiated geometry and fiber layout. We examine how the proposed methods enabled the industrial prefabrication of a building-scale G/CFRP dome structure and discuss the industrial process relative to key fabrication parameters. Highlighting the interdisciplinary nature of the research, we envisage future directions and applications for RCFW in construction. Overall, we find that synergy between academia and industry is essential to meeting research, productivity, and certification goals in the rather conservative building industry.},

After some stimulation measures at the beginning of the crisis, the market was hit hard by several government policies in both the rented and the owner-occupied sectors. Against this background this paper pays attention to the disfunctioning of the Dutch housing market and to current housing issues which are high on the political agenda. The paper argues that the contemporary Dutch housing market serves as an engine for social inequality and leads to sharp divisions and instability in society, in social, political and in economic terms. The paper then offers some solutions for these significant housing market problems.},

  abstract = {Quadrilateral remeshing approaches based on global parametrization enable many desirable mesh properties. Two of the most important ones are (1) high regularity due to explicit control over irregular vertices and (2) smooth distribution of distortion achieved by convex variational formulations. Apart from these strengths, state-of-the-art techniques suffer from limited reliability on realworld input data, i.e. the determined map might have degeneracies like (local) non-injectivities and consequently often cannot be used directly to generate a quadrilateral mesh. In this paper we propose a novel convex Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) formulation which ensures by construction that the resulting map is within the class of so called Integer-Grid Maps that are guaranteed to imply a quad mesh. In order to overcome the NP-hardness of MIQP and to be able to remesh typical input geometries in acceptable time we propose two additional problem specific optimizations: a complexity reduction algorithm and singularity separating conditions. While the former decouples the dimension of the MIQP search space from the input complexity of the triangle mesh and thus is able to dramatically speed up the computation without inducing inaccuracies, the latter improves the continuous relaxation, which is crucial for the success of modern MIQP optimizers. Our experiments show that the reliability of the resulting algorithm does not only annihilate the main drawback of parametrization based quad-remeshing but moreover enables the global search for high-quality coarse quad layouts - a difficult task solely tackled by greedy methodologies before.},

These processes can considerably change the process chain organization and therefore are growing interest in both academics and industrials. Despite these developments in this field, many problems remain on current digital chain that uses old format such as STL and G-code. A solution to challenge this issue is the development of a new digital chain based on the STEP-NC standard (Standard for the Exchange of Product Model Data compliant Numerical Control). This paper intends to propose a methodology for the integration of additive manufacturing to a new STEP-NC model. In order to illustrate this model’s possibilities a STEP-NC Platform for Advanced Additive Manufacturing is presented. Finally the integration of this platform in a multi-process context and satisfying Industry 4.0 requirements is highlighted as perspective.},

  abstract = {Design is the first step in manufacturing, and it is where most of the important decisions are made that affect the final cost of a product. Since 1980, analysis techniques have been made available which can guide designers towards products which are easy to manufacture and assemble. The availability of these techniques has created a revolution in manufacturing industry, especially in the USA, leading to reduced product cost, better quality, shorter time to market, lower inventory, few suppliers, and many other improvements. The paper first stresses the importance of taking careful account of manufacturing and assembly problems in the early stages of product design. Then, using a case study, the philosophy of the Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DFMA) methodology and its application are explained. The historical development of dessgn-for-assembly and design-for- techniques in Japan, Europe and the USA is presented. A review of published case histories emphasizes the enormous advantages to be gained by adopting this relatively new approach as the major tool in concurrent and simultaneous engineering. Finally, a discussion of the various roadblocks affecting DFMA implementation is followed by a discussion of current developments, which include product design for disassembly, service and recycling.},

The primary energy input (mainly fossil fuels) in the production of building materials was found to be about 60–80\% higher when concrete frames were considered instead of wood frames. The net greenhouse gas (GHG) balance for wood materials will depend strongly on how the wood is handled after demolition of the building. The nrt GHG balance will be slightly positive if all the demolition wood is used to replace fossil fuels, slightly negative if part of the demolition wood is re-used, and clearly positive if all wood is deposited in landfills, due to the production of CH4. However, if the biogas produced is collected and used to replace fossil fuels, the net GHG emissions will be insignificant. If concrete frames are used, the net GHG emissions will be about those when demolition wood from the wood-framed building is deposited in landfills and no biogas is collected. We have considered that the CO2 released from the chemical processes in the production of cement will be re-bound to the concrete by the carbonisation process. Otherwise, the net GHG emission would be more than twice as high when concrete frames are used. If forest biomass is used instead of fossil fuels, the net area of forest land required to supply both raw material and energy for the production of building materials, will be about twice as high when wood frames are used instead of concrete frames. However, the GHG mitigation efficiency, expressed as CO2 equivalents per unit area of forest land, will be 2–3 times higher when wood frames are used if excess wood waste and logging residues are used to replace fossil fuels. The excess forest in the concrete frame alternative is used to replace fossil fuels, but if this forest is used for carbon storage, the mitigation efficiency will be higher for the first forest rotation period (100yr), but lower for the following rotation periods. Some of the data used in the analyses are uncertain, but an understanding of the complexity in comparing different alternatives for utilising forest for GHG mitigation, and of the fact that the time perspective applied affects the results markedly, is more important for the results than the precise figures in the input data.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the design and fabrication process of a concrete column cast in ultra-thin, 3D printed formwork, using a process known as Eggshell. The column was prefabricated as part of a real-world construction project, serving as the main load-bearing element for a reciprocal timber frame structure. The fabrication of the column required upscaling of the Eggshell process, to allow for the fabrication of elements of an architectural scale. Furthermore, several challenges had to be addressed such as: integration of reinforcement, establishing the formwork design space, and scaling up the 3D printing process. For the production of the final column a 1.5 mm thin formwork was 3D printed, after which it was combined with a prefabricated reinforcement cage and filled with concrete in a set-on-demand casting process. The successful realization of the project provides a first example of a fullscale building element produced with the Eggshell fabrication process. By 3D printing the formwork, geometrical freedom in concrete construction is greatly expanded, as well as formwork waste reduced.},

Inspired by continuum mechanics, we derive a set of continuumbased potentials that can be efficiently incorporated within our solver. We demonstrate the generality and robustness of our approach in many different applications ranging from the simulation of solids, cloths, and shells, to example-based simulation.

  abstract = {Depuis le début des années 1990, l'ordinateur a introduit de nouvelles réalités technologiques dans les pratiques architecturales. Le changement s'est opéré progressivement, aux travers de plusieurs expérimentations, qui ont entrainé l'appropriation de certains logiciels et environnements de programmation, et aussi l'élaboration de nouvelles machines de fabrication. De nombreux architectes ont d'ailleurs expérimenté ces nouvelles technologies dans l'objectif de trouver de nouveaux modes d'exploration de la forme. Ces explorations architecturales constituent un corpus d'étude riche et fécond pour rendre compte des différentes conduites et attitudes adoptées vis-à-vis des technologies numériques. En s'appuyant sur certains penseurs de la technique comme le philosophe Gilbert Simondon, cette recherche a défini des sensibilités singulières propres aux architectes, construites par étapes successives, et modifiant à chaque fois leurs approches du projet. Notre démarche transductive montre que ces sensibilités technologiques s'avèrent à la fois structurantes et structurées par les explorations architecturales. Cette évolution des sensibilités participe autant que les projets à la construction d'un imaginaire numérique, lequel est à l'origine d'inventions architecturales particulières. Ces inventions architecturales propres au numérique ne se sont pas réalisées directement, mais au travers d'une articulation technologique complexe, intégrant les différentes phases du projet-objet. L'analyse de cette chaîne de relation a permis de suivre les tensions entre les désirs architecturaux et les potentialités technologiques qui ont structuré la période étudiée. Cette énergie humaine, déployée et accumulée sur plus de vingt ans d'expérimentations et d'explorations, a finalement laissé des traces sur les différentes couches du bâtiment, révélant par là certains aboutissements du numérique en architecture},

We then identify geometric criteria on the control polygon that guarantee that a Bézier curve has λ-residual below 0.4, which effectively implies that the curve is within 1\% of its arc-length to an elastic curve in the L² norm. Finally we give two projection algorithms that take an input Bézier curve and adjust its length and shape, whilst keeping the end-points and end-tangent angles fixed, until it is close to an elastic curve.},

  abstract = {The constructions of advanced architectural designs are presently very labour intensive, time consuming, and expensive. They are therefore only applied to a few prestige projects, and it is a major challenge for the building industry to bring the costs down and thereby offer the architects more variability in the (economically allowed) designs—i.e., to allow them to think out of the box. To address this challenge The Danish National Advanced Technology Foundation (now Innovation Fund Denmark) is currently supporting the BladeRunner project that involves several Danish companies and public institutions. The project aims to reduce the amount of manual labour as well as production time by applying robots to cut expanded polystyrene (EPS) moulds for the concrete to form doubly curved surfaces. The scheme is based upon the so-called Hot Wire or Hot Blade technology where the surfaces are essentially swept out by driving an Euler elastica through a block of EPS. This paper will be centered around the mathematical challenges encountered in the implementation of this idea. Since the elastica themselves are well known and described in the works of Euler et al. already in eighteenth century, these new challenges are mainly concerned with the rationalization of the architects’ CAD drawings into surfaces that can be created via this particular sweeping and cutting technology.},

  abstract = {Construction techniques associated with traditional raw earth architecture are characterised by laborious manual tasks in which each clay mix is deposited in layers over a light formwork, such as with the wattle and daub technique. More sustainable solutions also exist for the use of concrete, including shotcrete or sprayed concrete over light formwork composed of fabrics, inflatables or metal meshes. This research explores robotic techniques for the digital fabrication of monolithic earthen shells, with the objective of reformulating the use of clay as a sustainable material to reduce laborious tasks, minimize the use of formwork, and to implement robotic fabrication processes. This unique technique is called “bioshotcrete” and is characterised by an innovative fabrication process of sequential robotic spraying deposition of different natural raw clay mixes over a temporary light formwork. Two case studies are described and analysed featuring two distinctive techniques: clay mixes sprayed with a robotic arm and with a drone. Details are highlighted, and key considerations are identified, in terms of subtle adjustments for the material formulation and application sequences, robotic tooling strategies, and customised robotic actions. This series of experiments was formulated as an ongoing experiment to address challenges related to limitations of reaching distances and lightness of machines to bring on site, and to explore newfound possibilities for aerial deposition techniques using drones. Variations related to Tool/Matter performance (spray velocity and surface adhesion) were explored at each clay mixture iteration. Additional improvements were identified by recent physical tests, such as using the drafts created by the drone helixes to help the drying process at each layer, and additional conclusions establish how this technique is not only shaping new design and digital fabrication processes but envisioning possible future applications and offering new scenarios for sustainable large-scale earthen envelopes.},

Through this emergence comes the focus of natural, recyclable and local materials overlapped with global access to data and digital tools. We are now able to explore the possibilities of merging these technologies together and develop a new system of design. By examining the collaboration of these techniques, what can this tell us for the future of architecture? As this field is gains momentum in exploring the process of production, we were guided to focus on a system in additive manufacturing. The research of Magnetic Architecture explores the use of different sensors and various digital tools to understand the possible trajectories digital fabrication can provide to a future design process.},

Conversely large hot-wire cutting machines, able to cut large objects, often lack the ability to create surfaces with complex geometrical features. Therefore there is a need to develop rapid prototyping and manufacturing technologies capable of producing large objects in a rapid manner directly from CAD data. Large sized freeform objects made of soft materials, such as polystyrene foam, have numerous uses including; conceptual design of commercial products, automotive design, aerodynamic and hydrodynamic testing, advertising, film making, medical supports, sporting equipment and props for the entertainment industry. Plastic foam cutting rapid prototyping is a relatively new technology capable of producing large plastic foam objects directly from CAD data. This paper will describe nine such technologies that have been developed or are currently being developed at institutions around the world.},

  abstract = {Innovators in construction companies do not have extensive experience evaluating on-site robots compared to traditional construction methods for a given project. Prior work observed that managers could take up to 10 months to compare the robot with the traditional performance without a consistent method among different evaluators. As new construction robots are being deployed on site, innovation managers in construction need to systemize and reduce the effort of such comparisons. This paper contributes a robot evaluation framework (REF) for innovators in construction based on three decades of literature and three in-depth case studies. It focuses on the Product, Organization, and Process feasibility and compares the Safety, Quality, Schedule, and Cost to recommend robot adoption using the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) multi-criteria decision analysis method. By applying the REF to ten real industry cases, each conducted independently by two graduate students in collaboration with a General Contractor and a robot manufacturer or start-up, this study provides initial quantitative and qualitative evidence that the REF is useful beyond the initial three cases to guide innovation managers in construction. This paper validates how the framework impacts the consistency of results and effort among several evaluators, who utilized more than 80\% of the suggested REF variables. It also offers comparative Safety, Quality, Schedule, and Cost insights of the ten robots. The ten cases were selected to address different on-site robot cases and various construction project types in eight countries. Future work will expand the types of robots and projects to determine whether the framework needs further specialization to evaluate different robot types.},

These rammed earth walls were constructed and exposed for 20 years to natural weathering, in a wet continental climate. None of these walls have shown complete collapse to date. A method to measure the rammed earth walls erosion by stereo-photogrammetry has been developed. The result shows that the mean erosion depth of the studied walls is about 2mm (0.5\% wall thickness) in the case of rammed earth wall stabilised with 5\% by dry weight of hydraulic lime and about 6.4mm (1.6\% wall thickness) in the case of unstabilised rammed earth walls. The stabilisation enables to not use any plaster to protect the walls. In the case of the unstabilised rammed earth walls, an extrapolated lifetime longer than 60 years can be assessed. This shows a potential for the use of unstabilised rammed earth in the similar climatic conditions with this study. The method of stereo-photogrammetry used to measure the erosion of rammed earth walls on site may also help to calibrate and develop more pertinent laboratory test to assess the durability of rammed earth wall.},

Some earthen structures built centuries ago are still performing satisfactorily. However, in a lot of cases, the problem of durability still raises questions, since earthen material is very sensitive to water and since the maintenance is not always well done. This paper presents a study on the influence of water on the mechanical characteristics (compressive strength, Young modulus and Poisson ratio) of rammed-earth material. Experiments on suction were also carried out to study the relationship between suction and mechanical characteristics of rammed-earth. The results show that for low water contents: which are from the dry state (in the atmospheric conditions) to 4wt.\%, the mechanical properties are constant. Explanations of this result are presented in relation to the capillary force between particles at the microscopic level of the material.},

  abstract = {Concrete is a material favored by architects and builders alike due to its high structural strength and its ability to take almost any form. However, to shape concrete structures, heavy-duty formwork is usually necessary to support the fresh concrete while curing. To expand geometrical freedom, three-dimensional (3D) printed concrete formwork has emerged as a field of research. This article presents one possible application, a novel fabrication process that combines large-scale robotic fused deposition modeling 3D printing with simultaneous casting of a fast-hardening, set-on-demand concrete. This fabrication process, known as ‘‘Eggshell,’’ enables the production of nonstandard concrete structures in a material-efficient process. By casting a fast-hardening concrete in a continuous process, lateral pressure exerted by the fresh concrete is kept to a minimum. In this way, a 1.5-mm-thin thermoplastic shell can be used as a formwork, without any additional support. Geometries of different scales are tested in this article to evaluate the feasibility of the Eggshell fabrication process in an architectural context. An array of printing materials are also tested, and several different reinforcement concepts are analyzed. The findings are used to produce a full-scale architectural demonstrator project. This article shows that a wide range of concrete geometries can be produced in a material-efficient fabrication process, paving the way toward mass customization and structural optimization within concrete architecture.},

  abstract = {CAD/CAM techniques for rapid prototyping, profile cutting, and form sculpting/routing/moulding are well-advanced for the vehicle and manufacturing industries. Although their migration to the building sector is readily achievable as a substitution for much of traditional construction, there are factors that work against this. Apart from the singular ‘one-off’ nature of most architectural projects that limits ready exploitation of techniques derived in the main for mass-manufacture, there remains the problem of apprenticeship, and how to maintain a healthy lineage of skills for work otherwise less readily taken-up using automated manufacturing procedures. Continuing construction for Gaud´ı’s Sagrada Fam´ılia Church in Barcelona has provided a fertile test-bed for integrating rapid prototyping and CAD/CAM production where appropriate. Nevertheless, human factors such as maintaining the status quo with regard to apprenticeship and maintaining the skill lineage have provided some healthy insights into both the risks as well as the opportunities for greater involvement with CAD/CAM, and in particular, rapid prototyping in the building construction sector.

The design was undertaken on site, design description in Australia some eighteen thousand kilometres distant, stone-cutting a thousand kilometres distant in Galicia, with the completion of the window in March 2001. The entire undertaking was achieved within a timeframe of fifteen months from the first design sketch. Within this relatively short period, the entire team achieved a new marriage between architecture and construction, a broader relationship between time-honoured craft technique with high technology, and evidence of leading the way in trans-global collaboration via the Internet. Together the various members of the project team combined to demonstrate that the technical office on site at the Sagrada Família Church now has the capacity to use ‘just-in-time’ project management in order to increase efficiency. The processes and dialogues developed help transcend the tyranny of distance, the difficult relationship between traditional craft based technique and innovative digitally enhanced production methods, and the three generational age differences between the youngest and more senior team members.},

We suggest that this type of complex layered graph is effective for displaying large data sets to a mass audience. We provide a mathematical analysis of how this layered graph relates to traditional stacked graphs and to techniques such as ThemeRiver, showing how each method is optimizing a different “energy function”. Finally, we discuss techniques for coloring and ordering the layers of such graphs. Throughout the paper, we emphasize the interplay between considerations of aesthetics and legibility.},

This problem could be faced by providing adequate multistorey building solutions while using sustainable and eco-friendly materials, preferably from renewable or upcycled and locally available sources. These materials tend to have lower mechanical properties than those commonly used in conventional structures and therefore not adequate for elements subjected to bending such as floor slabs. This challenge can be met by improving the strength of the locally available materials and/or using geometries specifically designed to lower the structural stresses such as funicular structures. In this study, a novel clay-based cementless material is used. Different mixtures and additives were tested to achieve similar processing advantages as concrete. A parabolic arched floor element is designed based on a parametric analysis using graphic statics to reduce structural stresses and weight. The fabrication system is based on reusable formworks in which locally available earth is used as part of the mould. A four meters span arched floor is built to analyse its structural behaviour and to evaluate the proposed fabrication method.},

  abstract = {Almost a generation ago, the early software for computer aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) spawned a style of smooth and curving lines and surfaces that gave visible form to the first digital age, and left an indelible mark on contemporary architecture. But today's digitally intelligent architecture no longer looks that way. In \emph{The Second Digital Turn} , Mario Carpo explains that this is because the design professions are now coming to terms with a new kind of digital tools they have adopted -- no longer tools for making but tools for thinking. In the early 1990s the design professions were the first to intuit and interpret the new technical logic of the digital age: digital mass-customization (the use of digital tools to mass-produce variations at no extra cost) has already changed the way we produce and consume almost everything, and the same technology applied to commerce at large is now heralding a new society without scale -- a flat marginal cost society where bigger markets will not make anything cheaper. But today, the unprecedented power of computation also favors a new kind of science where prediction can be based on sheer information retrieval, and form finding by simulation and optimization can replace deduction from mathematical formulas. Designers have been toying with machine thinking and machine learning for some time, and the apparently unfathomable complexity of the physical shapes they are now creating already expresses a new form of artificial intelligence, outside the tradition of modern science and alien to the organic logic of our mind.},

As is seen in a number of areas, we have also begun to encounter the use of parametric designs produced with parametric design systems and wooden materials in urban landscaping. The purpose of this study is to examine the upper cover application and seating elements generated by taking advantage of parametric designs from wooden construction materials in urban landscaping areas, and examine the impact of wooden material characteristics while generating behavior and parametric structures of technologies. After researching parametric design and wooden material concepts, an attempt was made to reach conclusions through analyses conducted by examining parametric wooden designed pavilion and seating element specimens applied in various regions of the world.},

  abstract = {In the early stages of maker practice, there are many practical problems or design errors that need to be taken care of on their own. In order to lower the manufacturing threshold and obtain as much information on the relevant services as possible, makers sometimes try to simulate and test their works in digital ways before manufacturing them. However, after the process of digital simulation, the maker must hand over the design drawings to the manufacturing unit to develop the prototype. This materialization step requires a long period of time for the consultation, waiting, manufacturing, and adjustment phases. Thus, how to shorten and facilitate the timeline of the prototyping process has become a very important issue in the analysis of a maker’s design practice manufacturing workflow. This article advances a “seeing-moving-seeing” design thinking model that can help designers refine their ideas through observations, as they can directly see the result of their intuitive gestures and present their works with design media. This model, therefore, makes it easier for the makers to explain what they are thinking. In addition, through the model, they can further extend the possibilities of multiple production processes by designing, manufacturing, and integrating tools through the use of a robotic arm. The “seeing-moving-seeing” model proposes that there are three different aspects that respond to the temporary design prototyping process: human features, physical features, and robotic arm manufacturing. We simplify the communication of computing systems through an immersive visual interface and the rendering of real-time feedback, so that makers can focus upon their practice of implementing design ideas.},

As the world and society are dynamically changing, especially in this digital era, the research dares to challenge the Utilitas, Firmitas, and Venustas of the traditional architectural Weltanschauung, and rejects them by adopting the novel notion that architecture should be dynamic, fluid, and interactive. This project reflects{$<$}br/{$>$}a trajectory from the 1960’s with the advent of the avant-garde architectural design group, Archigram, and its numerous intriguing and pioneering visionary projects. Archigram’s non-standard, mobile, and interactive projects profoundly influenced a new generation of architects to explore the connection between technology and their architectural projects. This research continues this trend of exploring novel design thinking and the framework of Interactive Architecture by discovering the interrelationship amongst three major topics: “Computation”, “Embodiment”, and “Biology”. The project aims to elucidate pioneering research combining these three topics in one discourse: “Bio-inspired digital architectural design”.},

Many needs to build temporary buildings may occur at the same time randomly around all over the world. Constructing an efficient and economical solution is the motivation of this research. Through a comprehensive review of all past related researches and architectural practices, “convenience” and “recyclability” have been identified as two important features of temporary buildings in the post-pandemic era. In this article, we carry on a novel research of discrete architecture. Based on the design paradigm of discrete architecture, this research uses the three main components of S/U/P to develop a Lego Architecture design method by combining with the Grasshopper plug-in under the Rhino platform to write a program that automatically generates the target plan. Then, a typical design scheme for physical construction verification and structural optimization is selected to ensure landing and safety. Originating from the thinking of productization, this research attempts to package the design methods and related knowledge into a systematic solution, relying on an open construction system framework to achieve a rapid, simple and safe construction of temporary buildings after disasters.},

Hence, it is essential to develop automated tool path-planning methods to replace manual paint path planning. The purpose of this paper is to review the existing automated tool path-planning methods, and investigate their advantages and disadvantages.},

  abstract = {Early studies on robot machining were reported in the 1990s. Even though there are continuous worldwide researches on robot machining ever since, the potential of robot applications in machining has yet to be realized. In this paper, the authors will first look into recent development of robot machining. Such development can be roughly categorized into researches on robot machining system development, robot machining path planning, vibration/chatter analysis including path tracking and compensation, dynamic, or stiffness modeling. These researches will obviously improve the accuracy and efficiency of robot machining and provide useful references for developing robot machining systems for tasks once thought to only be capable by CNC machines. In order to advance the technology of robot machining to the next level so that more practical and competitive systems could be developed, the authors suggest that future researches on robot machining should also focus on robot machining efficiency analysis, stiffness mapbased path planning, robotic arm link optimization, planning, and scheduling for a line of machining robots.},

In this work we demonstrate that Martian soil simulant Mars-1a can be directly compressed at ambient into a strong solid without additives, highlighting a possible aspect of complete Martian in-situ resource utilization. Flexural strength of the compact is not only determined by the compaction pressure but also significantly influenced by the lateral boundary condition of processing loading. The compression loading can be applied either quasi-statically or through impact. Nanoparticulate iron oxide (npOx), commonly detected in Martian regolith, is identified as the bonding agent. Gas permeability of compacted samples was measured to be on the order of 10−16\,m2, close to that of solid rocks. The compaction procedure is adaptive to additive manufacturing.},

Different and sometimes contradictory proportions of clay, silt, sand and gravel are proposed for rammed earth soils.

Ten artificial soil batches (five of them stabilised with cement and/or lime) deemed suitable for rammed earth according to the current guidelines were tested in terms of compressive strength, shrinkage and erosion. The investigation shows that complying with soil particle size distribution criteria does not alone necessarily mean suitability of a soil for rammed earth. Based on these results, this paper proposes recommendations and criteria to be implemented in the assessment of soil for rammed earth.},

It has been developed as a vernacular technique in different civilizations. Since then, the focus was mainly on gypsum, lime, or pozzolan stabilization. Recently, cement has become one of the commonly used additives in earth stabilization, which consequently reduce the environmental advantage of earth. This paper deals with a reverse engineering approach for low environmental impact earth stabilization technique, aiming the replacement of cement in earth stabilization. Various earth-mixtures were done to investigate the performance of this technique. Water contact behaviour and compressive strength of the stabilized earth specimens was determined. Moreover, the characterization of the stabilization effect has been performed through X-ray powder diffraction patterns (XRD) and clearly identify the production of ettringite using very low CO 2 intensive raw materials. Furthermore, the carbon footprint of the stabilized earth-mix has been determined with the help of LCA (life cycle assessment) calculation. The laboratory analyses on this mix-design have proven a high water-resistance and the results show a remarkable increase in compressive strength. Finally, these results open a new avenue for earth stabilization and secure the implementation of this material in the conventional construction industry.},

Here we take advantage of the numerical computation capability of Matlab to complete the first portion of design tasks. Consequently, the proposed integration of these two CAD tools comes into play, which involves writing the joint angle values calculated from Matlab to.tab text files first. These.tab files are then directly used as the input for joint angles’ drivers in Pro/Mechanica’s virtual motion analysis function.},

  abstract = {Inca masons mastered a unique procedure of stone construction resulting in complex and precise configurations of visually zero-tolerance alignment. Each stone is nibbled away by a gradual transition of hammerstones from course to fine as the carving approaches a precise alignment on each edge at the visible face. Beyond this shared front edge, a gap opens to allow mortar to be packed in from behind for structural and setting purposes. These formations are limited to vertical walls as a result of the use of plumb technology. With so much current attention being focused on free-form geometries and procedural methods for masonry vaulting (Andriaenssens et al. 2014), this paper proposes a translation of the Inca wedge method into a digital process whereby stones align with each other to produce a global figure without the use of templating, falsework, or formwork. This differs from most conventional masonry processes whereby mortar is applied to units before positioning, allowing alignment to templates through the malleability of the mortar. Instead, units are dry fit to each other and then set in place. This inversion of the alignment procedure relies on precision carving of voussoirs to align with each other at specific moments in order to ensure proper self-assembly while simultaneously accepting mortar for setting. The resulting prototype shell structure is composed of uniquely carved voussoirs of autoclave-aerated concrete set with plaster in a similar manner to the Catalan and Guastavino methods. Previous research (Ramage 2006) has demonstrated the advantage of this lightweight material for vaulting purposes. The combination of this material property with the Inca assembly method results in an expedient assembly of complex shell structures. The potentials of this proof-of-concept suggests through results that future research can advance the intelligence of error aggregation through the aid of measuring, correcting, and carving throughout the assembly process just as the Incas constructed.},

This method employs a multi-axis robotic arm fitted with a hot-knife to carve foam into mass-customized negatives. In doing so, it re-engages a gothic craft tradition of producing unique volumetric architectural elements. The act of rapidly carving volumetric material mines knowledge from the past in an effort to create novel forms that are not possible in the aggregation of standard building components. This chapter advocates for, prototypes, and analyses this variable, sympathetic, and reciprocal approach that carving once offered the built environment.

The vault is a compression-only structure calculated through a custom particle-spring physics simulation program to determine how large each unit's opening should be in order to adjust its volume, and therefore mass, in relation to its neighbors. This project exemplifies Matter Design's dedication to translating past (and often lost) methods into contemporary culture. We are truly conflicted. We are pre-occupied with computational design and digital fabrication -commonly assumed to be rapid, fashionable, and surfacial, though simultaneously pre-occupied with volume -thick, heavy, ancient, and permanent. We also maintain an emphasis on speculation, and yet our dedication to reality resists this claim. We intend to innovate and transform the future of architecture, yet we look to history in order to do so. Somewhere in this milieu of confusion and confliction is the kernel that defines us. Marc Jarzombek recently suggested one could determine how well a society is doing by their ability to precisely carve stone. We like his metric for its simplicity, but also for its assumption that we must not be doing so well today. So much of the discussion surrounding the digital in design has focused on the surface. We are not immune. Much of our previous research has dealt with the economically friendly sheet material, while maintaining a common thread of a dedication to volume. This dedication originally manifested in volumetric occupation through bending from 2D to 3D. More recently this desire has formalized into stereotomic (the art of cutting solids, most typically stone) research with such projects as Periscope: Foam Tower and Temporal Tenancy. These projects mined the past knowledge of stereotomy as a way to robotically carve foam for temporary installations. The irony of these projects is the transfer of knowledge from heavy stone construction to an application for light temporary projects that require tensile cables to stabilize. While the irony exists, these exercises in carving solids could also be applied to materials with significant We also maintain},

There was no significant difference in the yield between plants established from rhizome cuttings or by micro-propagation. Annual off-takes of N and P were easily met by soil reserves, but soil K reserves were low in unfertilized plots. Potassium deficiency was associated with lower harvestable yield. Yields increased for 5 years following establishment but after 10 years showed some decline which could not be accounted for by the climate driven growth model MISCANMOD. Measured yields were normalized to estimate both autumn (at first frost) and spring harvests (15 March of the subsequent year). Average autumn and spring yields over the 15 harvest years were 13.4±1.1 and 9.0±0.7 t DW ha−1 yr−1 respectively. Below ground biomass in February 2002 was 20.6±4.6 t DW ha−1.

  abstract = {A central biological question is how natural organisms are so evolvable (capable of quickly adapting to new environments). A key driver of evolvability is the widespread modularity of biological networks--their organization as functional, sparsely connected subunits--but there is no consensus regarding why modularity itself evolved. While most hypotheses assume indirect selection for evolvability, here we demonstrate that the ubiquitous, direct selection pressure to reduce the cost of connections between network nodes causes the emergence of modular networks. Experiments with selection pressures to maximize network performance and minimize connection costs yield networks that are significantly more modular and more evolvable than control experiments that only select for performance. These results will catalyze research in numerous disciplines, including neuroscience, genetics and harnessing evolution for engineering purposes.},

  abstract = {Developing robot agnostic software frameworks involves synthesizing the disparate fields of robotic theory and software engineering while simultaneously accounting for a large variability in hardware designs and control paradigms. As the capabilities of robotic software frameworks increase, the setup difficulty and learning curve for new users also increase. If the entry barriers for configuring and using the software on robots is too high, even the most powerful of frameworks are useless. A growing need exists in robotic software engineering to aid users in getting started with, and customizing, the software framework as necessary for particular robotic applications. In this paper a case study is presented for the best practices found for lowering the barrier of entry in the MoveIt! framework, an open-source tool for mobile manipulation in ROS, that allows users to 1) quickly get basic motion planning functionality with minimal initial setup, 2) automate its configuration and optimization, and 3) easily customize its components. A graphical interface that assists the user in configuring MoveIt! is the cornerstone of our approach, coupled with the use of an existing standardized robot model for input, automatically generated robot-specific configuration files, and a plugin-based architecture for extensibility. These best practices are summarized into a set of barrier to entry design principles applicable to other robotic software. The approaches for lowering the entry barrier are evaluated by usage statistics, a user survey, and compared against our design objectives for their effectiveness to users.},

This paper presents a novel hierarchical B-Rep graph shape representation which encodes information about the surface geometry and face topology of the B-Rep. To learn from this new shape representation, a novel hierarchical graph convolutional network called Hierarchical CADNet has been created, which has been shown to outperform other state-of-the-art neural architectures on feature identification, including machining features that intersect, with improvements in accuracy for some more complex CAD models.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the role of commercially available natural building materials, including lime mortars, natural fibres and wood panels on the indoor air quality. Initially, the emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from building materials were identified and measured. Subsequent tests then considered the adsorption and re-emission behaviour of four VOCs: toluene, limonene, dodecane and formaldehyde. The significance of this paper lies in its demonstration that emissions are dependent on the chemical composition of building materials and the production process, whereas the adsorption/desorption characteristics are related to the material microstructure and the polarity of the VOCs. The results allow the performance of a construction material, in terms of its influence on indoor air quality, to be deduced from knowledge of chemical composition and microstructure. This paper provides a new approach to assessing the influence of different building materials on indoor air quality when they are exposed to gaseous pollutants.},

  abstract = {This life cycle assessment evaluates the environmental impacts of two emergent masonry blocks designed to serve as sustainable replacements for conventional masonry blocks. The emergent blocks offer the same strength, durability, and form as conventional structural concrete blocks, and include hollow cores to enable placement of reinforcement in accordance with standard construction practices. The first emergent block consists of stabilized engineered soil that is compacted to reduce the use of ordinary Portland cement and eliminate curing. The second block, which is also compacted, contains alkali activators that promote a geopolymerization reaction among naturally occurring aluminosilicate clays, eliminating the need for ordinary Portland cement. QuantisSuite 2.0 software is used to perform a cradle to gate life cycle assessment comparing the environmental impacts of the two blocks to conventional concrete blocks across a range of indicators. The compacted stabilized soil block offers 46\% less embodied carbon than conventional concrete block, which it outperforms in all categories except water consumption. The compacted alkali-activated block reduces embodied carbon by 42\% when compared to concrete block, but has a higher impact on ecosystem, water withdrawal and resources. In terms of ecosystem and health indicators, the compacted stabilized soil block is the preferred building block, while conventional concrete block architectural blocks are the most water efficient. As understanding of alkali activation improves and manufacturing of compacted block is optimized, further environmental benefits are possible in both stabilized soil block and the alkali-activated block.},

  abstract = {Non-residential circular construction projects using bio-based materials have been realised in the United Kingdom. Case studies include the Adnams Distribution Centre, the University of East Anglia’s Enterprise Centre and the British Science Museum’s hempcrete storage facility. The bio-based buildings utilise the natural properties of bio-based materials to insulate and regulate internal environments, particularly with reducing fluctuations in temperature and relative humidity, which can be harmful to sensitive stored products and artefacts. Projects have been successful on both on environmental and physical performance levels; however, they have not led to a subsequent proliferation of non-residential large-scale circular projects within the UK using emerging bio-based materials. This study examines why and uses analysis based upon exclusive interviews with key figures associated with three case studies. Challenges faced include the ability to upscale production by manufacturers of bio-based materials, problems surrounding initial costs, gaining accreditation for materials, the vested interests present in the construction industry and levels of knowledge among clients and construction professionals. Potential upscaling solutions identified include long-term financial savings on running costs and high staff productivity, policies regarding grants, incentives and planning applications and local economic regeneration.},

The map indicates, for each pixel in the objects (or the background) of the originally binary picture, the shortest distance to the nearest pixel in the background (or the objects). A map with negligible errors can be produced in two picture scans which has to include forward and backward movement for each line. Thus, for expanding/shrinking purposes it may compete very successfully with iterative parallel propagation in the binary picture itself. It is shown that skeletons can be produced by simple procedures and since these are based on Euclidean distances it is assumed that they are superior to skeletons based on d4−, d8−, and even octagonal metrics.},

  abstract = {A Pattern Language by Christopher Alexander is renowned for providing simple, conveniently formatted, humanist solutions to complex design problems ranging in scale from urban planning through to interior design. This text is also believed to be the most widely read architectural treatise ever published. Despite this, there is also little acknowledgement in its popular reception that it is only one part of a trilogy of works documenting Alexander’s ‘second theory’ of architecture. Thus, while A Pattern Language is widely referenced in architectural scholarship, most of these references simply acknowledge its existence and fail to engage with its content. Furthermore, the literature that does critically engage with Alexander’s theory, challenging its ideas and assumptions, is often difficult to find, and the criticisms are diverse and complex. The intent of this paper is to facilitate a deeper understanding of these criticisms and the relationships between them. The 28 criticisms identified in past research are organised hierarchically in this paper into three tiers representing those associated with the: (i) conceptualisation, (ii) development and documentation and, (iii) implementation and outcomes of Alexander’s theory. The relationships between these criticisms are then mapped diagrammatically thereby forming the basis for thematic groupings within each hierarchical tier. This organisation reveals that only two criticisms relate to the concept of pattern languages in isolation, while the remainder arise, directly or indirectly, from Alexander’s idiosyncratic ontological and epistemological positions. The conclusion analyses the relationships between the criticisms to develop a holistic and understanding of where the problems in Alexander’s theory might lie.},

Therefore, many researchers attempted to equip six-axis industrial robots (IRs) with milling end-effectors to explore the robot’s large and flexible working envelope. However, IRs lack stiffness and have limited force, resulting in low accuracy, poor surface roughness (SR), and low material removal rate (MRR). On the contrary, electric discharge machining (EDM) is a non-conventional process capable of shaping complex profiles in any conductive material. Since the EDM process has no physical contact between the electrode and the workpiece, it can machine diverse hard-to-cut materials accurately and free of vibration. However, to this day, EDM is found in limited conditions of CNC machines only. Thus, this research investigates a synergistic combination of IR and milling EDM. Adopting advanced CAM tools and offline programming, it examines pre-designed electrodes working analogue to conventional milling to perform the desired machining by intricate cutting paths. The results deliver a robotic machining technique able to cut hard materials using small industrial robots yet free of vibration and not pose dependent.},

Currently, WEDM is found in rigid bed-based CNC machines constraining the workpieces in geometry and size. Parallelly, the stochastic nature of WEDM and the lack of complete mathematical models make it complex to control. As a result, whenever the servo feed becomes faster than the material removal rate, short circuits and wire break occur. On the other hand, traditional machining using six-axis industrial robots (IR) have been extensively investigated for cost efficiency, improved envelope and virtually unlimited axis combination. However, the IR design offers low stiffness, facing severe vibrations in machining hard-to-cut materials, resulting in low accuracy, poor finishing, and lack of repeatability. Thus, IRs are not comparable to CNC. The present research reviews the ideal servo control strategies for a synergistic combination of a novel machining technic of WEDM working with an IR as the servo. Employing a theoretical analysis followed by a series of simulations, it is demonstrated how the combination can be successfully controlled by frequency modulation, delivering a robotic process able to machine any hard-to-cut conductive material yet free of vibration.},

  abstract = {Many industrial robot applications require fewer task constraints than the robot’s degrees of freedom. For welding robots, for example, rotations of the welding torch around its axis do not negatively impact welding quality. Furthermore, the tool center point’s Cartesian position and desired orientation as a function of time is often determined by the (manufacturing) process. Nevertheless, programming these robots can be time consuming. Reducing or eliminating this programming cost will allow robots to be used for producing small series. Recently, a promising software package for Cartesian path planning with the name Descartes was released by the ROS-Industrial community. To the authors’ knowledge, an in-depth description of this algorithm and an experimental evaluation is lacking in literature. This paper describes the path planning approach used by the Descartes package. Moreover, the software’s performance is evaluated for several key robot welding tasks and the encountered limitations are discussed. In addition, we show that the planner’s performance can be improved by changing the cost function that the planner’s graph search algorithm minimises.},

  abstract = {Building construction is a great area for automation, but the incorporation of robots in the construction industry is a very slow affair because of the intrinsic difficulties. New requirements, however, now call for material-handling manipulators to be used to help operators move and position heavy payloads without accidents. Builders are also being encouraged to provide automatic tools by the EU labour legislation, which limits the maximum payload that operators are allowed to carry. This paper introduces a manipulator to assist the operators in handling and installing pre-manufactured plaster panels for indoor-wall construction. This six degrees of freedom manipulator is fixed between floor and ceiling so that it can carry heavy payloads without tumbling. The whole system is easily assembled and disassembled to facilitate transportation between construction sites. The system’s main features and its functions are presented.},

  abstract = {This thesis examines the additive manufacturing (AM) of concrete, its possibilities, feasibility and advantages over existing techniques. The first part generally focuses on the characteristic properties of concrete that are important and how they relate to an AM method, for instance aggregates and reinforcement. After this extensive introduction in the field of concrete and AM, the current situation regarding additive manufacturing of concrete is described. On the basis of literature resulting products are shown and discussed. Their characteristics are compared to detect a match or mismatch between the AM technique and the produced elements. The outcome of this evaluation is used to describe improvements which are elaborated in the second part. This design part consists of a roadmap that shows a future vision. Concrete is a new material in the field of additive manufacturing. Since it is one of the materials that hardens by a chemical reaction, considerable attention needs to be paid to the workability of it in an AM process. Traditional processing techniques are adapted to these characteristics but concrete does not let itself dictate how to behave. The roadmap envisions how the technique has to evolve in order to implement the characteristic properties of concrete. The possibilities for products made with an additive process are endless, but just replacing existing production methods with additive ones is impossible. Although improved freeform production techniques are still the aim of this research, this does not mean that more freedom in form is by definition the largest improvement that AM can offer at the moment. From another point of view the implementation of additional functions in traditional products can be of great value. Product ideas and an evaluation of the techniques shown in the vision are related to the developments to achieve an increase in speed, surface quality and strength in the AM production technique, next to the requirements that have to be set regarding a matching fresh concrete mixture. These essential aspects of the process lead to the important conclusion that in the AM of concrete, both material and production technique have to be matched precisely. Next to matching process and material it is important to match process and product. Concrete is widely used and not all products should be made using an AM process. Simply copying standardized elements does not add the added value layered fabrication methods can achieve if used adequately.},

  abstract = {Organic granular materials offer a valid alternative for non-biodegradable composites widely adopted in building construction and digital fabrication. Despite the need to find alternatives to fuel-based solutions, current material research in architecture mostly supports strategies that favour predictable, durable and homogeneous solutions. Materials such as soil, due to their physical properties and volatile nature, present new challenges and potentials to change the way we manufacture, built and integrate material systems and environmental factors into the design process. This article proposes a novel fabrication framework that combines high-resolution three-dimensional-printed biodegradable materials with a novel robotic-additive manufacturing process for soil structures. Furthermore, the research reflects on concepts such as affordance and tolerance within the field of digital fabrication, especially in regards to bio-materials and robotic fabrication. Soil as a building material has a long tradition. New developments in earth construction show how earthen buildings can create novel, adaptive and sustainable structures. Nevertheless, existing large-scale earthen construction methods can only produce highly simplified shapes with rough geometrical articulations. This research proposes to use a robotic binder-jetting process that creates novel organic bio-composites to overcome such limitations of common earth constructions. In addition, this article shows how biological polymers, such as polysaccharides-based hydrogels, can be used as sustainable, biodegradable binding agents for soil aggregates. This article is divided into four main sections: architecture and affordance; tolerance versus precision; water-based binders; and robotic fabrication parameters. Digital Soil envisions a shift in the design practice and digital fabrication that builds on methods for tolerance handling. In this context, material and geometrical properties such as material porosity, hydraulic conductivity and natural evaporation rate affect the architectural resolution, introducing a design process driven by matter. Digital Soil shows the potential of a fully reversible biodegradable manufacturing process for load-bearing architectural elements, opening up new fields of application for sustainable material systems that can enhance the ecological potential of architectural construction.},

  abstract = {Most works in Multi-Cellular Artificial Ontogeny solve the halting problem by arbitrarily limiting the number of iterations of the developmental process. Hence, the trajectory of the developing organism in the phenotypic space is only required to come close to an accurate solution during a very short developmental period. Because of the well-known opportunism of evolution, there is indeed no reason for the organism to remain close to a good solution in other situations: if the development is continued after the limiting bound; if the environment is perturbed by some noise during the development; if the development takes place in different physical conditions. In order to increase the robustness of the solution against such hazards, a new stopping criterion for the developmental process is proposed, based on the stability of some internal energy of the organism during its development. Such adaptive stopping criterion biases evolution toward solutions in which robustness is an intrinsic property. Experimental results on different “French flag” problems demonstrate that enforcing stable developmental process makes it possible to produce solutions that not only accurately approximate the target shape, but also demonstrate nearperfect self-healing properties, as well as excellent generalization capabilities.},

The generative representation encodes the parameters of a trusses design as a mapping from a 2D space. The ontogenic representation encodes truss design parameters as a local truss transformation iterated several times, starting from a trivial initial truss. Both representations are tested with a naive Evolution Strategy based optimization scheme, as well as the state-of-the-art HyperNEAT approach. We focus both on the best objective value obtained and the computational cost to reach a given level of optimality. The study shows that the two solutions representations behave very differently. For experimental settings with equal complexity, with the same optimization scheme and settings, the generative representation provides results which are far from optimal, whereas the ontogenic representation delivers near-optimal solutions. The ontogenic representation is also much less computationally expensive than a direct representation until very close to the global optimum. The study questions the scalability of the generative representations, while the results for the ontogenic representation display a much better scalability.},

With the technology of additive manufacturing, geometrical freedom can instead be utilised to integrate functional requirements into mono-material building components. In this research, the additive manufacturing method of lightweight concrete extrusion and its potential for thermal performance via geometric customisation is explored. It investigates whether the insulating performance of wall components can be increased through the creation of closed cellular structures, and further, whether these performance features can be functionally graded by locally adapting the geometric properties. A design tool for closedcell wall geometries is created, which integrates lightweight concrete extrusion related fabrication constraints and takes into account thermal and structural performance considerations. Through the simulation of heat transfer, generated wall geometries are analysed for their thermal performance. By calculating the layer cycle times and determining the overhang during extrusion, the structural capacity during printing is validated. Finally, experimental manufacturing of 1:1 scale architectural prototypes is executed to test the feasibility of the concept.},

The architectural qualities of these assemblies as well as the constructional feasibility of lightweight stereotomic parts were tested through a series of designs that culminated in large architectural constructions, including a free-standing wall, a pavilion prototype and a free-standing interior pavilion employing lightweight, free-form Cyclopean masonry.},

The main challenge in developing a real-time training simulator for concrete spraying machinery lies in the modeling of shotcrete application. This article presents a novel method that models and simulates in real time the three main factors influencing shotcrete sprayability: adhesion, cohesion, and rebound. Furthermore, thanks to the addition of an obstacle model, the method makes it possible to spray onto additional supporting elements, which is a typical shotcrete application. The proposed method considers a wet-mix thick flow spraying process and is based on experiments that were run with a real concrete spraying machine and complemented by expert advice. The method was developed and evaluated using a user-centered methodology, resulting in realistic shotcrete application modeling that meets the needs for training concrete spraying machinery operators.},

  abstract = {With the foundation of the Bauhaus, Walter Gropius advocated an end to the division between arts and crafts. Contrary to the idea of architecture as art, the programme of the school aimed to assimilate architecture with industry in order to satisfy collective social needs. Yet, despite this programmatic declaration, such a project was realised only after Gropius’ departure from the Bauhaus, under the controversial directorship (1927–1930) of the Swiss architect Hannes Meyer. Meyer achieved unprecedented success both in terms of academic production and financial performance. Yet his realisations were paralleled by the leftist radicalisation of the school’s politics: Meyer transformed the workshops into factory production units and the students into industrial workers. Eventually, the politicisation of the school cost Meyer his office and a negative reputation in historical records that still holds today. This article posits that Meyer achieved his success at the Bauhaus not despite his radical allegiance, but precisely because of it. The realism of Meyer’s strategy is evaluated through his capacity to anticipate many developments in the organisation of architectural production. In particular, his critique of intellectual labour in architecture is confronted with the contemporary proletarisation of architects in the Western world.},

Topology optimization - a method widely applied in the aeronautical and automotive industries - may enable material reductions of up to 70 pct. in concrete structures, while generating novel, architectural forms. The realization of such complex structural morphologies however, calls for the development of new digital means of construction. The publication illustrates the development of new experimental, robotic production methods for the fabrication of novel architectural structures, and contextualizes the application of structural optimization as an architectural design strategy through historical examples, spanning from 18th century physics-based methods to contemporary building practices.},

  abstract = {Earthen masonry is generally brittle, weak and poor in damage resilience. There is historic evidence that natural fibers such as straw and horsehair have been used to reinforce earthen masonry to prevent desiccation cracks and improve tensile strength. However, fibers have also been known to negatively affect mechanical properties such as compressive strength (an important quality control parameter for load bearing masonry) by creating voids and lowering density. This paper reports on findings of a study directed at investigating the feasibility of avoiding such problems in compressed and stabilized earth blocks through optimizing the fiber length when using soil from Newberry, Florida. Standard polypropylene fibers were selected for the study. The two different lengths of fibers studied were 54 mm and 27 mm. The test results showed a general improvement in compressive strength of the fiber reinforced matrices compared to the unreinforced ones. While an improvement in modulus of rupture (MOR) was observed for matrices reinforced with 54 mm fibers, results varied for the other fiber-reinforced matrices. An improvement in post-initial crack behavior was observed for all fiber-reinforced matrices compared to the unreinforced ones. The 54 mm fibers yielded the best results based on the influence on MOR, compressive strength, and deformability compared to the other matrices.},

  abstract = {In situ Additive Manufacturing (AM) has developed into an active research and industry-transfer area, mainly due to the increasing need for productive and sustainable methods in the concrete construction industry in combination with novel technological enablers. While current systems for in situ AM are often single large-scale stationary facilities, Mobile Additive Manufacturing (MAM) systems are an emerging technology that could provide scalability for AM processes on construction sites. This scalability is achievable through cooperability of multiple mobile robots on individual 3D printing tasks, while their mobility and autonomy enable deployment in both new and existing contexts, and coordination of operations for the direct and indirect interaction with humans. To ensure applicability and scalability, MAM closely integrates architectural, mechanical, and materials design, the manufacturing process, sensing, and control. With this paper, we give a comprehensive review of research trends, open questions and key performance indicators. We support the discussion with potential architectural application scenarios. Overall, we aim to indicate why addressing MAM is an inherently multi­ disciplinary challenge.},

  abstract = {The development of novel robotic fabrication technologies in architecture concentrates largely on integrating stationary industrial-type robots into off-site prefabrication processes. By contrast, few enabling robotic technologies exist today that allow robotic fabrication processes to be mobile and implemented directly on building sites. While mobile in situ fabrication offers a large range of architectural potentials, its realization requires to address fundamental challenges. First, the production of large-scale and potentially monolithic structures on-site requires an advanced robotic fabrication system that can fulfill the material, structural- and architectural-related demands associated with it. Second, the poorly structured nature of building sites requires mobile robotic systems to be equipped with advanced sensing and control solutions to contend with uncertain conditions found on-site. The research discussed in this paper addresses both of these subjects. It applies a novel construction system for non-standard reinforced concrete structures, termed Mesh Mould, to explore the fabrication of large-scale and monolithic building structures using a mobile robot on site. It further investigates sensor-integrated adaptive fabrication strategies to achieve the accurate fabrication of such a large-scale structure, and this is done despite prevalent uncertainties related to the building site environment, the mobile robotic system, and the material behavior during fabrication. The results of this research were realized in a slender, doubly curved, reinforced concrete wall at the DFAB HOUSE at NEST. This research demonstrator provides the unique opportunity to present robotic in situ fabrication not merely as a future possibility, but as a reality applied to a tangible construction project.},

The shown research is focused on robotically-manufactured, structurally-optimised reinforcement structures which are prefabricated and can be encased by concrete through SC3DP in a combined process. Based on the reinforcement concept of "reinforcement supports concrete," the prefabricated cages support the concrete during application in a combined AM process. To demonstrate the huge potential of combined AM processes based on the SC3DP and WAAM techniques (for example, the manufacturing of individualized CPS), the so-called FLOWall is presented here. First, the form-finding process for the FLOWall concept based on fluid dynamic simulation is explained. For this, a three-step strategy is presented, which consists of (i) the 3D modelling of the element, (ii) the force-flow analysis, and (iii) the structural validation in a computational fluid dynamics software. From the finalized design, the printing phase is divided into two steps, one for the WAAM reinforcement and one for the SC3DP wall. The final result provides a good example of efficient integration of two different printing techniques to create a new generation of freeform coastline protection structures.},

However, for the techniques available, there is still a severe lack of knowledge of the functional interaction of processing technology, concrete rheology and admixture usage. For shotcrete 3D printing technology, we present the effect of accelerator dosages (0\%, 2\%, 4\% and 6\%) on fresh concrete properties and on interlayer strength. Therefore, early yield stress development up to 90 min is measured with penetration resistance measurements. Deformation of layers under loading is investigated with digital image correlation and a mechanical testing machine. One point in time (10 min after deposition) is examined to quantify vertical buildability of elements depending on the accelerator dosage. Four different interlayer times (0, 2, 5 and 30 min), which occur for the production of small and large elements as well as due to delay during production, are investigated mechanically as well as quantitatively with computed tomography regarding the formation of cold joints. With increased accelerator dosage, an instantaneous increase in early age yield stress and yield stress evolution was observed. An increase in interlayer time leads to a reduced strength. This is mainly attributed to the observed reduced mechanical interlocking effect of the strands. Finally, a model to describe interlayer quality is presented. In the end, advantages as well as limitations of the findings are discussed.},

Four incorporation ratios of coarse natural aggregate (CNA) with coarse recycled concrete aggregates from concrete (CRCA) were studied: 0\%, 20\%, 50\% and 100\%. The mechanical properties of the dry-mix shotcrete were obtained in an independent experimental campaign. Initially, the technical viability of CRCA shotcrete was validated for deep rock tunnels, based on the convergence-confinement method. Two cases were studied to determine the equivalent thickness for each combination of replacement ratio using CRCA shotcrete: (i) similar stiffness and (ii) similar yield stress. Subsequently, an economic assessment was performed. The stiffness criterion increased the thickness below 10\% in both the 20\% and 50\% replacement ratios, which shows their technical viability with very marginal cost increase ({$<$}5\%). On the other hand, the maximum pressure criteria required higher increments, close to 30\% in the 50\% replacement ratio. A full replacement was proven to be impracticable in both analyses.},

  abstract = {This work presents a generalized method for robotic mortar extrusion, allowing the fabrication of structural-insulating walls of novel performances. It involves two distinct steps that are to be simultaneously automated: extrusion of a specifically formulated mortar, and assembly of adequately shaped insulating blocks. Here, the layer by layer approach of concrete printing is renewed by using insulating blocks as support for the extrusion. The volumetric space of the wall is divided by an adequate space tessellation, dividing it in polyhedra. They become insulating blocks, on the edges of which mortar is extruded. The set of edges then forms a space truss, of great mechanical efficiency. “Printable” mortar is crucial to the system for the blocks could not withstand the hydrostatic pressure of fresh mortar without additional form-work features, once a few meters height has been reached. This approach renews traditional confined masonry, allowing for geometric complexity and automation.},

  abstract = {For the tens past years, important development has been achieved on the adaptation of additive manufacturing to the construction industry using concrete. They mostly concerns control rheology at fresh state, setting time, and technology advances. Nevertheless, the reinforcement of 3D printed part remains an open question. Different reinforcement protocols have been proposed in the literature, often based on traditional way of reinforcement. In this context, the aim of this paper is to present an alternative way to reinforce extruded concrete or other pasty materials inspired by the composite industry. The present patented manufacturing methodology is based on extrusion-based additive manufacturing, inspired by pultrusion and co-extrusion process of polymer composites, but taking full advantage of the specific rheological behaviour of cementitious matrix. It consists in the continuous addition of numerous continuous yarn in the extruded mortar before the final extrusion. A comparison between those processes is made. Depending on the number of yarns and their sizes, this process is showed to provide ductility for limited amount of reinforcement and have the potential to be an alternative to passive rebar traditionally used in concrete by providing a true reinforcement in traction to the structure for larger number of yarns, changing extruded concrete in unidirectional composite with brittle matrix. Using appropriate matrix formulation, the mastering of its yield stress during the extrusion is showed to be the most important process parameters.},

Conventional machines rely on straight wires and are thus limited to creating piecewise ruled surfaces. In this work, we propose a method that exploits a dual-arm robot setup to actively control the shape of a flexible, heated rod as it cuts through the material. While this setting offers great freedom of shape, using it effectively requires concurrent reasoning about three tightly coupled sub-problems: 1) modeling the way in which the shape of the rod and the surface it sweeps are governed by the robot's motions; 2) approximating a target shape through a sequence of surfaces swept by the equilibrium shape of an elastic rod; and 3) generating collision-free motion trajectories that lead the robot to create desired sweeps with the deformable tool. We present a computational framework for robotic hot wire cutting that addresses all three sub-problems in a unified manner. We evaluate our approach on a set of simulated results and physical artefacts generated with our robotic fabrication system.},

In this work, we initiate the exploration of the use of tools from deep learning for the automated design of optimal auctions. We model an auction as a multi-layer neural network, frame optimal auction design as a constrained learning problem, and show how it can be solved using standard machine learning pipelines. We prove generalization bounds and present extensive experiments, recovering essentially all known analytical solutions for multi-item settings, and obtaining novel mechanisms for settings in which the optimal mechanism is unknown.},

The CEB mixture was further stabilized using Portland cement, lime, and sodium silicate. The research significance is based upon the urgent need of most developing countries (e.g. Jordan, Egypt…etc) to build more durable and low-cost houses by using locally available materials. As a result, CEB was identified as a cheap and environmentally friendly construction material. CEB specimens were thoroughly characterized by studying the mechanical properties and durability characteristics. Blocks of 30 x 15 x 8 cm with two holes of 7.5 cm in diameter have a potential for higher enduring, higher compressive strength, better thermal insulation, and lower production cost. Blocks were manufactured with an addition of 8 \% for either Portland cement or lime, as well as 2 \% of sodium silicate to the soil. The results showed that the addition of 8 \% of cement to the CEB achieves satisfactory results in both mechanical and durability properties. Also, the addition of sodium silicate was found to enhance the early-age compressive strength however it affected negatively the durable properties of blocks by increasing the erosion rate and deterioration when exposed to water.},

  abstract = {While the digital era has brought with it a vast assortment of tools from which we can generate form and geometry, often the result is a tendency to focus primarily on either surfaces or solids as a means of modeling for representation or fabrication. Consequently, this impacts the various fabri-cation and construction techniques deployed in order to realize such digital models. In certain aca-demic environments, this has led to a divide between discussions and methodologies surrounding surface, and those surrounding solids or volume. And while the desire to implement new methods and materials into both research and practice grows, such a divide may only hinder the potential for speculative material exploration. This paper presents an approach to coalesce generative techniques of surface generation via computational tools, and fabrication strategies for constructing volumetric elements through a process of backfilling. The paper will highlight current research through an ongo-ing project, which aims to merge strategies for mass-customized mold making via robotic hot-knife cutting, composite materials, and hybrid design and fabrication methodologies.},

  abstract = {The Italian Radical Architecture collective Superstudio was infamous for their refusal to participate in architectural design. Their muteness was directed, however: they did not wish to secede entirely from architectural discourse, it was building from which they withdrew. This essay investigates Superstudio’s negation alongside Italian leftist attempts to recast the meaning of work. From the alienation of assembly line production to a more holistic form of labor, this shift in the nature of work privileged the individual sovereignty of citizens and workers. This emphasis on creative autonomy informs a new reading of Superstudio’s Supersurface as well as their Histograms.},

  abstract = {This paper presents four key developments that are leading to the scalability of the fabrication processes of mycelium material. We develop a biological and digital fabrication pipeline for (1) growing large mycelium composite blocks, (2) on-site robotic wire-cutting, (3) using mycelium materials as a multi-functional formwork, and (4) implementing the self-healing of fungal organisms. The purpose of the research is to investigate the processing approaches, variable material handling and materials properties of large biohybrid (composed of biological and non-biological material) foam blocks. The robotic tool provides the freedom to shape and structure this novel biological material and opens the possibility of making unique architectural modules. For the first time, mycelium materials are robotically wire-cut in situ, which results in two demonstrators. Departing from an application-based intention, we test the compatibility of thermal insulating mycelium formwork with a concrete slab. As such, we combine two different materials with hybrid physical and architectural properties. Additionally, we investigated the self-healing and living properties of mycelium components after robotic implementation. The combination of microbiological systems and fibrous substrates creates a unique class of bioactive composite materials, with potential applications at in the construction sector.},

This paper presents continuous, mobile Robotic Plaster Spraying (RPS) – a thin-layer, spray-based printing-in-motion tech­ nique using cementitious plaster – realized on a prototypical construction site. The experimental setup consists of a fully mobile, custom wheeled base that is synchronized with a robotic arm, and an integrated pumping and spraying system. In this 1:1 scale application, the print layers are executed during the motion of the mobile robot and they are printed vertically on the walls of an existing building structure. The experiments showcase the potentials of producing bespoke – three-dimensional – or standardized – flat – plasterwork with the proposed technique. The results demonstrate the applicability and scalability of RPS and the findings contribute to the research on mobile additive fabrication.},

  abstract = {Embedded in a long tradition of craftsmanship, inside or outside building surfaces, is often treated with plaster, which plays both functional and ornamental roles. Today, plasterwork is predominantly produced through rationalized, time-, and cost-efficient processes, used for standardized building elements. These processes have also gained interest in the construction robotics field, and while such approaches target the direct automation of standardized plasterwork, they estrange themselves from the inherent qualities of this malleable material that are well known from the past. This research investigates the design potentials of robotic plaster spraying, proposing an adaptive, thin-layer vertical printing method for plasterwork that aims to introduce a digital craft through additive manufacturing. The presented work is an explorative study of a digitally controlled process that can be applied to broaden the design possibilities for the surfaces of building structures. It involves the spraying of multiple thin layers of plaster onto a vertical surface to create volumetric formations or patterns, without the use of any formwork or support structures. This article describes the experimental setup and the initial results of the data collection method involving systematic studies with physical testing, allowing to develop means to predict and visualize the complex-to-simulate material behavior, which might eventually enable to design with the plasticity of this material in a digital design tool.},

In this technique, the print layers are vertical unlike most 3DCP processes. The goal is to explore the applicability and scalability of this spray-based printing technique. In this study, RPS is combined with an augmented interactive design setup, the Interactive Robotic Plastering ( IRoP ), which allows users to design directly on the construction site, taking the building structure, as-built state of the on-going fabrication and the material behavior into consideration. The experimental setup is an on-site robotic system that consists of a robotic arm mounted on a semi-mobile vertical axis with an integrated, automated pumping and adaptive spraying setup that is equipped with a depth camera. The user interaction is enabled by a controller-based interaction system, interactive design tools, and an augmented reality interface. The paper presents the challenges and the workflow that is needed to work with a complex material system on-site to produce bespoke plasterwork. The workflow includes an interactive design procedure, localization on-site, process control and a data collection method that enables predicting the behavior of complex-to-simulate cementitious material. The results demonstrate the applicability and scalability of the adaptive thin-layer printing technique and address the challenges, such as maintaining material continuity and working with unpredictable material behavior during the fabrication process.},

  abstract = {The construction industry is responsible for one-quarter of the solid waste generated globally, much of which is excavated soil. Repurposing this soil for the use of earthen architecture (EA) will reduce a considerable amount of this waste. However, little research has been conducted on how to assess the use of EA within the architectural, engineering, environmental and economic context, and in comparison with other construction system solutions. This paper presents the development of an integrated building information modelling (BIM) and life cycle assessment (LCA) framework to explore what advantages EA may have, based on the client’s needs and the building’s requirements. The decision-making conditions and criteria for the use of EA are firstly identified in an extensive literature review supported by interviews with decision-makers. A workflow is secondly proposed to apply a LCA evaluating the decision criteria in a BIM tool at the early-design stages. This method allows for the evaluation and comparison of choice criteria as functional requirements of the building and objectives set by the decision-makers. The flexibility of setting input parameters in this tool increases the visibility of the potential benefits of EA over other construction systems. Along with this approach, upcoming applications on case studies will aim to be replicable by designers, based on their practices and design tools, to support clients in their choice of using EA.},

The paper attempts to review the existing standards and norms on the earth construction, and bring out the need for comprehensive standard codes on earth construction. An analysis of the existing standard codes on earth construction has been provided. There are about 70 standards, but there is lack of coherence among the standards and globally acceptable terminology. The paper highlights the points needing attention while developing comprehensive globally applicable standards on different types of construction methods.},

The assessment of earth material performances requires the development of appropriate procedures and standards. This is discussed in particular for the characterisation, hygrothermal behaviour, mechanical behaviour, and durability of earth materials. One other important challenge, since one of the main advantages classically put forward, is its ecological performance, is a proper assessment of life cycle assessment of earth materials, elements and buildings. Moreover, the paper develops why the approach to earthen construction must be different compared to the dominant construction materials, to preserve its ability to contribute to the ecological transition in the construction sector. In particular, the needs of using local soils, with an architectural approach coping with the limits of the materials, and developing an architectural optimisation to preserve the earthen materials multifunctionality rather than selecting a sole property to be maximised. Lastly, the findings of the paper can be used to develop a holistic approach to earthen construction to foster the development of new earthen architecture projects.},

Preliminary studies carried out in order to test adequate reinforcement systems for earthen structures, demonstrated that jute fabric applied with a stabilized earth plaster, among other natural fibers or systems, is able to develop exceptional adhesion and adequate stiffness. However, the collapse mechanisms observed seems to favor the rupture of reinforcement rather than the crisis of adhesion usually observed when dealing with artificial FRC reinforcements. It was necessary to step back to the theories of adhesion to plan the experimental analysis of the jute reinforcement for rammed earth structures. The poor material, the fact that adhesive and support are almost the same material (differing only for grain size, density and a small amount of gypsum), the difficulty in measuring fabric properties, strength and, most of all, local deformation and fracture energy in earthen materials, induced to define a specific procedure. The uncertainties connected to the determination of mechanical parameters were overcome both using statistical approach and numerical analysis of data, and reducing the number of parameters necessary to the analysis, that is turning to simple adhesion models.},

For this reason, constitutive models provided by engineering simulation software for mechanical analysis, to describe low tensile strength materials, have been used to reproduce mechanical tests and have been compared. The arch was selected as the best case study to test the response of constitutive models suitable for a low tensile strength material and, in a successive stage of research, the efficiency and the modelling of reinforcement techniques.},

  abstract = {The vault of the Arles City Hall, or Hôtel de Ville, represents the architect’s revenge on the corporations of masons. Completed in 1676, the relationship of span to rise of the vault make it the boldest work of masonry in Europe, and while this complex vault appears to be a unitary structure, two vaults actually share the work, leaning against each other on the big arch. Bibliographic and archival research showed that surveys of the vault were missing; the only ancient survey was lost in the 1970s. A recent survey campaign made an analysis possible, leading to a hypothesis about the architect Mansart’s choices, based on hypothetical solutions to resolve the formal construction issues of the vault. A connoisseur of geometry and optics, Mansart knew that the human eye was unable to perceive the exact geometry of a surface. Knowing that he couldn’t control the intersections of vault portions and then the joints of the rows in the space, he introduced a solution that involved drawing the intersections in plan and then projecting them on the vault to obtain the spatial intersections. No further constructions of the bold type followed the vaulted space in the Hôtel de ville, because the spatial research that linked the new discipline (stereotomy) to the quality of architectural space had by then come to an end.},

The DMPC actor is a Model Predictive Control (MPC) optimizer with an objective function defined in terms of a value function estimated by the critic. We show that our MPC actor is an importance sampler, which minimizes an upper bound of the cross-entropy to the state distribution of the optimal sampling policy. In our experiments with a Ballbot system, we show that our algorithm can work with sparse and binary reward signals to efficiently solve obstacle avoidance and target reaching tasks. Compared to previous work, we show that including the value function in the running cost of the trajectory optimizer speeds up the convergence. We also discuss the necessary strategies to robustify the algorithm in practice.},

The big concern, however, is that its production results in the emission of a large amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) which contributes to the cumulative CO2released worldwide which is recognised as one of the main contributing factors to climate change and the greenhouse gas effect, which results in global warming. Olivine with chemical formula (Fe,Mg)2SiO4 is a suitable mineral for CO2 sequestration; additionally due to its high Magnesium oxide (MgO) content, it may be a sustainable material for soil stabilization. The chemical combination of Olivine categorizes this mineral in the class of pozzolans. Magnesium oxide has a high potential for CO2 capturing and carbonated magnesia provides stability in soil and is thus an active layer in works on stabilizing slopes against sliding.},

  abstract = {Cement production is among the largest anthropogenic sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) and there is considerable pressure on the cement industry to reduce these emissions. In the effort to reduce CO2 emissions, there is a need for methods to systematically identify, classify and assess different improvement measures, to increase the knowledge about different options and prioritize between them. For this purpose a framework for assessment has been developed, inspired by common approaches within the fields of environmental systems analysis and industrial symbiosis. The aim is to apply a broad systems perspective and through the use of multiple criteria related to technologies and organization strategies facilitate informed decision-making regarding different CO2 performance measures in the cement industry. The integrated assessment framework consists of two parts: a generic and a case-specific part. It is applied to a cement production cluster in Germany called Cluster West, consisting of three cement plants owned by CEMEX. The framework can be used in different ways. It can be used as a tool to perform literature reviews and categorize the state-of-the-art knowledge about options to improve the CO2 performance. It can also be used to assess options for the cement industry in general as well as for individual plants. This paper describes the assessment framework, the ideas behind it, its components and the process of carrying out the assessment. The first part provides a structured overview of the options for improvement for the cement industry in general, while the second part is a case-specific application for Cluster West, providing information about the feasibility for different categories of measures that can reduce the CO2 emissions. The overall impression from the project is that the framework was successfully established and, when applied, facilitated strategic discussions and decision-making. Such frameworks can be utilized to systematically assess hundreds of different measures and identify the ones most feasible and applicable for implementation, within the cement industry but also possibly in other sectors. The results demonstrated that even in a relatively synergistic and efficient production system, like Cluster West, there are opportunities for improvement, especially if options beyond “production efficiency” are considered.},

Novel fabrication processes can be based on the unique affordances and characteristics of fiber composites. Because these materials are lightweight and have high tensile strength, a radically different approach to fabrication becomes possible, which combines low-payload yet long-range machines—such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)—with strong, precise, yet limited-reach industrial robots. This collaborative concept enables a scalable fabrication setup for long-span fiber composite construction. This paper describes the integrated design process and design development of a large-scale cantilevering demonstrator, in which the fabrication setup, robotic constraints, material behavior, and structural performance were integrated in an iterative design process.},

  abstract = {Unlike robotics in the manufacturing industry, on-site construction robotics has to consider and address two unique challenges: 1) the rugged, evolving, and unstructured environment of typical work sites; and 2) the reversed spatial relationship between the product and the manipulator, i.e., the manipulator has to travel to and localize itself at the work face, rather than a partially complete product arriving at an anchored manipulator. The presented research designed and implemented algorithms that address these challenges and enable autonomous robotic assembly of freeform modular structures on construction sites. Building on the authors' previous work in computer-vision-based pose estimation, the designed algorithms enable a mobile robotic manipulator to: 1) autonomously identify and grasp prismatic building components (e.g., bricks, blocks) that are typically non-unique and arbitrarily stored on-site; and 2) assemble these components into pre-designed modular structures. The algorithms use a single camera and a visual marker-based metrology to rapidly establish local reference frames and to detect staged building components. Based on the design of the structure being assembled, the algorithms automatically determine the assembly sequence. Furthermore, if a 3D camera is mounted on the manipulator, 3D point clouds can be readily captured and registered into a same reference frame through our marker-based metrology and the manipulator's internal encoders, either after construction to facilitate asbuilt Building Information Model (BIM) generation, or during construction to document details of the progress. Implemented using a 7-axis KUKA KR100 robotic manipulator, the presented robotic system has successfully assembled various structures and created as-built 3D point cloud models autonomously, demonstrating the designed algorithms' effectiveness in autonomous on-site construction robotics applications.},

  abstract = {This paper presents Gym-Ignition, a new framework to create reproducible robotic environments for reinforcement learning research. It interfaces with the new generation of Gazebo, part of the Ignition Robotics suite, which provides three main improvements for reinforcement learning applications compared to the alternatives: 1) the modular architecture enables using the simulator as a C++ library, simplifying the interconnection with external software; 2) multiple physics and rendering engines are supported as plugins, simplifying their selection during the execution; 3) the new distributed simulation capability allows simulating complex scenarios while sharing the load on multiple workers and machines. The core of Gym-Ignition is a component that contains the Ignition Gazebo simulator and exposes a simple interface for its configuration and execution. We provide a Python package that allows developers to create robotic environments simulated in Ignition Gazebo. Environments expose the common OpenAI Gym interface, making them compatible out-of-the-box with third-party frameworks containing reinforcement learning algorithms. Simulations can be executed in both headless and GUI mode, the physics engine can run in accelerated mode, and instances can be parallelized. Furthermore, the Gym-Ignition software architecture provides abstraction of the Robot and the Task, making environments agnostic on the specific runtime. This abstraction allows their execution also in a real-time setting on actual robotic platforms, even if driven by different middlewares.},

  abstract = {Integral structural optimization and fabrication seeks the synthesis of two original approaches; that of topological optimization (TO) and robotic hotwire cutting (HWC) (Mcgee 2011). TO allows for the reduction of up to 70\% of the volume of concrete to support a given structure (Sondergaard \&amp; Dombernowsky 2011). A strength of the method is that it allows to come up with structural designs that lie beyond the grasp of traditional means of design. A design space is a discretized volume, delimiting where the optimization will take place. The number of cells used to discretize the design space thus sets the resolution of the TO. While the approach of the application of TO as a constitutive design tool centers on structural aspects in the design phase (Xie 2010), the outcome of this process are structures that cannot be realized within a conventional budget. As such the ensuing design is optimal in a narrow sense; whilst optimal structurally though, construction can be prove to be prohibitively expensive.},

  abstract = {In the Portuguese context, the life cycle assessment of building materials is still in its infancy. So far, there is only a small number of Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) available, all target for industriallybased materials. Although vernacular earthen materials are seen as ecological materials, with low potential environmental impacts, there are no studies that allow to quantitatively compare these materials with conventional ones, according to the applicable standards. In the case of Portugal, there are no EPDs or studies for these materials and the studies available worldwide are hard to compare, since they not follow the same life-cycle assessment methodology. This paper aims at contributing to a better understanding about the environmental performance of earthen materials by presenting results from the life cycle assessment of Compressed Earth Blocks (CEBs) and Rammed earth, based on specific life cycle inventory values obtained from a producer company, following the guidance provided by the standard EN15804. Among other conclusions, results show that CEB and Rammed earth have a total Embodied Energy of 3.94 MJ/block and 596 MJ/1 m3 and a Global Warming Potential of 0.39 kg CO2 eq/block and 47.5 kg CO2 eq./1 m3, respectively. In a cradle-to-gate analysis of different walls, the use of earthen building elements can result in reducing the potential environmental impacts in about 50\%, when compared to the use of conventional ones. Additionally, the advantages of using earthen materials are also discussed for the different building life-cycle stages, focusing on the possibility to recycle these materials in a closed-loop approach.},

Since in most extant species the complex growth from zygote to adult organism is orchestrated by a complex gene regulatory network (GRN), the prevalent view is that the evolution of diverse morphologies must result from the evolution of diverse GRN topologies. By contrast, this work focuses on the unique effect of developmental processes through an abstract model of self-regulated structure without genetic regulation—only modulation of initial conditions. Here, morphologies are generated by a simple evolutionary algorithm searching for the longest instances of unfolding dynamics based on tensegrity graphs. The usual regulatory function of the genome is taken over by physical constraints in the graphs, making morphological diversity a pure product of structural complexification. By highlighting the potential of structural development, our model is relevant to both “structuralist” biological models and bio-inspired systems engineering.},

This paper discusses empirical research into the fabrication of complex and custom-designed geometries by means of robotic subtractive cutting, with a specific focus on modular elements and joint typologies that form an essential condition for selfsupporting stone structures. The paper presents research findings in two parts. In the first part, four case studies for jointing techniques and a cross-comparison between these are introduced to derive strategies for multiple criteria, including macro-and-micro geometries, modules and joints, structural performance, material variations, machine cutting methods and end-effectors, and robotic workspace. In the second part, the paper focuses on the structural performance of the joint geometry typologies, expanded towards material constraints and robotic fabrication process. The paper concludes with a discussion on these varied subtractive cutting methodologies and a resulting design-to-fabrication workflow, and indicates future research work.},

  abstract = {A growing strategy to reduce the energy consumption of buildings involves a combination of increased air tightness and high levels of insulation. However, an undesirable consequence of this approach is a deterioration of the Indoor Air Quality and accumulation of airborne pollutants, resulting from the reduction in ventilation. The chemical nature and concentration of indoor air pollutants is dependent on the building materials and activities of the occupiers. Recent studies have raised awareness of the effect of Indoor Air Quality on the perceived comfort levels, health and well-being of humans. This paper investigates the role of commercially available natural building materials including lime mortars, natural fibres and wood panels on the Indoor Air Quality. Initially the emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) from building materials were identified and measured. Subsequent tests then considered the adsorption and re-emission behaviour of four VOCs; toluene, limonene, dodecane and formaldehyde. The significance of this paper lies in its demonstration that emissions are dependent on the chemical composition of building materials and the production process, whereas the adsorption/desorption characteristics are related to material microstructure and polarity of the VOCs. The results allow the performance of a construction material, in terms of its influence on indoor air quality, to be deduced from a knowledge of chemical composition and microstructure. This paper provides a new approach for assessing the influence of different building materials on indoor air quality when exposed to gaseous pollutants.},

The study involves the entire production and testing process of the earthen elements, from the design, to the preparation of the mixture and the 3D printing, up to the uniaxial compression test on a wall segment. The results indicate that 3D-printed earthen elements have a compressive strength of 2.32 MPa, comparable to that of rammed earth structures. The experimental data also made it possible to draw conclusions on the action of the infill, which seems to have the function of stopping the propagation of cracks. This has a positive effect on the overall behavior of 3D-printed earthen elements, since it avoids the onset of dilative behavior in the final stages of the load test and maintains ultimate load values higher than 50\% of the maximum load.},

To meet the ever-growing environmental needs, the focus of the paper is on a particular type of biocomposite for the stabilization of earthen mixtures—the rice husk-lime biocomposite—and on how to enhance its effect on the long-term mechanical properties of the hardened product. Having assumed that the shredding of the vegetable fiber is precisely one of the possible ways to improve the mechanical properties, we compared the results of uniaxial compression tests performed on cubic specimens made with both shredded and unaltered vegetable fiber, for three curing periods. The results showed that the hardened earthen mixture is not a brittle material in the strict sense, because it exhibits some peculiar behaviors, anomalous for a brittle material. However, being a “designable” material, its properties can be varied with a certain flexibility to get as close as possible to the desired ones. One of the peculiar properties of the hardened earthen mixture deserves further investigation, rather than corrections. This is the vulcanization that occurs (in a completely natural way) in the long term, thanks to the mineralization of the vegetable fiber by carbonation of the lime.},

Our main contribution is a novel convolution operator based on B-splines, that makes the computation time independent from the kernel size due to the local support property of the B-spline basis functions. As a result, we obtain a generalization of the traditional CNN convolution operator by using continuous kernel functions parametrized by a fixed number of trainable weights. In contrast to related approaches that filter in the spectral domain, the proposed method aggregates features purely in the spatial domain. In addition, SplineCNN allows entire end-to-end training of deep architectures, using only the geometric structure as input, instead of handcrafted feature descriptors.},

The proposed SNS (Saturation in the Null Space) iterative algorithm proceeds by successively discarding the use of joints that would exceed their motion bounds when using the minimum norm solution and reintroducing them at a saturated level by means of a projection in a suitable null space. The method is first defined at the velocity level and then moved to the acceleration level, so as to avoid joint velocity discontinuities due to the switching of saturated joints. Moreover, the algorithm includes an optimal task scaling in case the desired task trajectory is unfeasible under the given joint bounds. We also propose the integration of obstacle avoidance in the Cartesian space by properly modifying on line the joint bounds. Simulation and experimental results reported for the 7-dof lightweight KUKA LWR IV robot illustrate the properties and computational efficiency of the method.},

Here, a life-cycle energy (LCEA) and carbon (LCCO2A) analysis is performed to evaluate the potential benefits of using an alternative, bio-composite building material made from hemp shives mixed with a lime binder, in the context of an arid environment. The physical properties and thermal performance of the hemp-lime building material are compared with conventional materials through lab tests, temperature measurements in test cells and thermal simulations. This study concludes that hemp-lime not only has a clear advantage over comparable conventional materials in terms of embodied energy, but also in terms of net CO2 emissions over the entire life cycle of a typical building. This is primarily due to the active carbon sequestration of the hemp plant during its growing phase, and the gradual sequestration of carbon emitted during the production of lime. The thermal properties and behaviour of a hemp-lime wall material were found experimentally to be virtually identical to those of a commonly-used lightweight concrete insulation material with a similar density.}

  abstract = {Contemporary design practices have enhanced the potential of architectural ornament to be innovative, beautiful, and highly sustainable. Historically, ornament has been known to express character and reveal relationships between materiality, technological advances, and societal evolution. Though ornament rapidly declined in the late 1800s, it has recently returned in contemporary design as a critical and discursive topic, while a new theme in sustainability, entitled “Circular Design,” has begun to gain popularity in the past few years. Circular Design goals aim to address the tremendous consumption of materials and energy present in the building industry by proposing the efficient management of both the energy embodied in building materials and the energy consumed in buildings during operation; although, circularity in design struggles to be widely adopted by the building industry largely due to its lack of a social dimension. Contrastingly, contemporary forms of ornament strive to participate in the expression of social values, hierarchies, and order - considerations that Circular Design could adopt to enhance its contribution to subjective wellbeing. Furthermore, contemporary ornament’s close link to advancements in digital design and fabrication have brought a wave new applications of architectural ornament along with capabilities for generating and producing building products that perform socially as well as work to overcome some of the inefficiencies and waste production currently present in traditional manufacturing methods. Contemporary Ornament for Circularity thus aims to effectively intersect research into Circular Design, ornamentation, and digital design and fabrication, in order to ask why buildings that aspire to be environmentally sensitive and technically advanced can’t also operate through aesthetic and cultural dimensions.},

So the design of systems such as simulation systems, cooperative systems or assistance systems includes a very accurate modelling of interactional and communicational levels. The agent-based approach provides an adapted abstraction level for this problem. After having studied the organizational context and communicative capacities of agentbased systems, to simulate the reorganization of a flexible manufacturing, to regulate an urban transport system, and to simulate an epidemic detection system, our thoughts on the interactional level were inspired by human-machine interface models, especially those in "cognitive engineering". To provide a general framework for agent-based complex systems modelling, we then proposed a scale of four behaviours that agents may adopt in their complex systems (reactive, routine, cognitive, and collective). To complete the description of multi-level agent models, which is the focus of this paper, we illustrate our modelling and discuss our ongoing work on each level.},

  abstract = {The construction industry is undergoing a technological revolution with the goal to increase productivity, efficiency, and functionality. The drivers for the necessary changes are associated with the ever-increasing shortage of skilled labour, growing number of construction projects, as well as the aims to reduce material waste of the construction and with it associated impact on the environment. Digital fabrication is leading the automation and digitization advancements impacting all phases of a building's lifetime, with an immediate effect on design, fabrication, assembly, and maintenance. These advancements are key enablers for the construction sector to meet rising global demand for more infrastructure and buildings, while operating in a world with ever-growing constraints on used resources.  In order for digital fabrication to establish and optimize the automated processes, an improved understanding of the behaviour of the fabricated structural elements before, during, and after fabrication is needed. For this, geometrical information about the fabricated objects and their changes over time with sufficient spatio-temporal coverage, resolution, and accuracy is required. Transition from highly controlled research environments to practical applications in industry requires the core-competence of engineers to design, plan, and realize measurement systems including processing with the appropriate technical characteristics, depending on the application. Making use of the metrology tools shows potential in tackling the existing challenges, such as localization of work pieces within the robotic setup and relative to the design models, handling of unknown, partially unknown or imprecise geometries and bespoke work pieces, reaction to unforeseen errors, surface inspection, as well as the unpredictability and complexity of the used cementitious materials, among others.  This thesis contributes to the advancement of automation and digitization of construction methods, specifically robotic spraying of concrete elements chosen as the application case. This is achieved by means of development of a measurement system employing state-of-the-art industrial depth cameras and a data processing scheme for 3D shape determination and assessment for digital fabrication. In particular, the main contributions presented in this thesis are: i) assessment and improvement of distance measurement accuracy for time-of-flight (ToF) camera Helios Lucid, including the development and implementation of the assessment procedure, ii) rebar detection and digital reconstruction for robotic concrete spraying, iii) geometric feedback system for robotic spraying, and iv) surface finish classification using depth camera data. The work presented in this thesis was conducted within the research consortium NCCR Digital Fabrication and as a part of the Innosuisse project of robotic concrete spraying.},

A construction example under investigation in this paper is robotic concrete spraying, where material is sprayed onto double-curved single layered rebar meshes. Before the spraying process can start, the location and geometry of the rebar mesh needs to be accurately know. We present an automatic image-based processing approach of depth images for grid point extraction at an accuracy of a few mm. Furthermore, we propose a sequence of execution steps in a robotic setup, including the hand–eye calibration, which enables the direct georeferencing of multiple data sets acquired from various poses into a common coordinate system. With the proposed approach we are able to digitally reconstruct a mesh of an unknown geometry in under 10 min with an accuracy better than 5 mm. The digitally reconstructed mesh allows for computation of material needed for its construction, enabling sustainable use of concrete in digital fabrication. The accurately reconstructed digital mesh, generated based on the proposed approach in this paper, is the input for the following spraying step, allowing for generation of accurate spray trajectories.},

We present a geometric feedback system that is integrated within a robotic setup and includes a set of depth cameras used for acquiring data on sprayed concrete structures, during and after fabrication. The acquired data are analyzed in terms of thickness and surface quality, with both sets of information then used within the adaptive fabrication process. The thickness evaluation is based on the comparison of the as-built state to a previous as-built state or to the design model. The surface quality evaluation is based on the local analysis of 3D geometric and intensity features. These features are used by a random forest classifier trained using data manually labelled by a skilled professional. With this approach, we are able to achieve a prediction accuracy of 87~\% or better when distinguishing different surface quality types on flat specimens, and 75~\% when applied in a full production setting with wet and non-planar surfaces. The presented approach is a contribution towards in-line material thickness and surface quality inspection within digital fabrication.},

When performed with a general 6-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) manipulator, there exists one DOF of redundancy that remains. By taking advantage of the symmetry axis of the welding electrode, the authors decompose the required instantaneous twist of the electrode into two orthogonal components, one lying into the relevant task subspace and one into the redundant task subspace, respectively. Joint-limits and singularity avoidance are considered as the optimization objectives.},

Initially, the notion of Immediate Systems (IS) is introduced and framed. IS offer interaction in the style of direct manipulation, embed design and implementation in situations of use, and overcome limitations of remote design. IS are related to psychological concepts and described through the lens of Gibson?s Theory of Affordances. Characteristics and conditions of IS are distilled from the presentation and discussion of a series of examples.0The application of IS in architecture is approached from three angles. First, from the lived perspective of a user-designer, as adhocist mode of action. Second, from the methodology and technology, as accelerated design transfer. Third, in an ecological perspective, as human-architecture symbiosis.0Following the method of research by design, prototypes were developed in a series of experiments. The experiments result in multiple tools for real-time multi-directional volumetric design exploration that allows users to interactively model and ad-hoc reconceptualize parametric geometry, topology and components of architectural assemblies. A combination of these tools with digital fabrication and interactive building components lead to the most encompassing IS-A prototype, an attempt to realize an open-ended building system that joins simultaneous design, adaptation, construction and reconfiguration as interaction possibilities embedded in the built environment.},

Detached fabrication is proposed as a method of fabricating both precise and indeterminate internal forms using an industrial robot to mediate the interaction of multiple materials and volumes without direct manipulation of a tool.

  abstract = {This paper begins by exploring matter as an aggregated system of energy transactions and modulations. With this in mind, it examines the notion of energy driven form finding as a design methodology that can simultaneously negotiate physical, environmental and fabrication considerations. The digital workspace enables this notion of form finding to re-establish itself in the world of architecture through a range of analytic tools that algorithmically encode real world physics. Simulating the spatial and energetic characteristics of reality enables virtual “form generation models that recognize the laws of physics and are able to create ‘minimum’ surfaces for compression, bending [and] tension” (Cook 2004). The language of energy, common in engineering and materials science, enables a renewed trans-disciplinary dialogue that addresses significant historic disjunctions such as the professional divide between architects and engineers. Design becomes a science of exploring abstracted energy states to discover a suitable resonance with which to tune the built environment.  ¶ A case study of one particular method of energy driven form finding is presented. Bi-directional Evolutionary Structural Optimization (BESO) is a generative engineering technique developed at RMIT University. It appropriates natural growth strategies to determine optimum forms that respond to structural criteria by reorganizing their topology. This dynamic topology response enables structural optimization to become an integrated component of design exploration. A sequence of investigations illustrates the flexibility and trans-disciplinary benefits of this approach. Using BESO as a tool for design rather than purely for structural optimization fuses the creative approach of the architect with the pragmatic approach of the engineer, enabling outcomes that neither profession could develop in isolation. The BESO case study alludes to future design processes that will facilitate a coherent unfolding of design logic comparable to morphogenesis.},

The theoretical base of this work builds on the combination of structural form-finding and state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. In the first step of the process, Combinatorial Equilibrium Modelling (CEM) is used to generate a large variety of spatial networks in equilibrium for given input parameters. In the second step, these networks are clustered and represented in a form-map through the implementation of a Self Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm. In the third step, the solution space is interpreted with the help of a Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection algorithm (UMAP). This allows gaining important insights in the structure of the solution space. A specific case study is used to illustrate how the infinite equilibrium states of a given topology can be defined and represented by clusters. Furthermore, three classes, related to the non-linear interaction between the input parameters and the form space, are verified and a statement about the entire manifold of the solution space of the case study is made. To conclude, this work presents an innovative approach on how the manifold of a solution space can be grasped with a minimum amount of data and how to operate within the manifold in order to increase the diversity of solutions.},

  abstract = {Creating artificial life forms through evolutionary robotics faces a “chicken and egg” problem: Learning to control a complex body is dominated by problems specific to its sensors and effectors, while building a body that is controllable assumes the pre-existence of a brain. The idea of coevolution of bodies and brains is becoming popular, but little work has been done in evolution of physical structure because of the lack of a general framework for doing it. Evolution of creatures in simulation has usually resulted in virtual entities that are not buildable, while embodied evolution in actual robotics is constrained by the slow pace of real time. The work we present takes a step in addressing the problem of body evolution by applying evolutionary techniques to the design of structures assembled out of elementary components that stick together. Evolution takes place in a simulator that computes forces and stresses and predicts stability of three-dimensional brick structures. The final printout of our program is a schematic assembly, which is then built physically. We demonstrate the functionality of this approach to robot body building with many evolved artifacts.},

Mechanical tests have been conducted with a clay soil supplied by a Scottish brick manufacture. Alginate (a natural polymer from the cell walls of brown algae) has been used as bonding in the composite. Sheep’s wool was used as reinforcement. Tests done showed that the addition of alginate separately increases compression strength from 2.23 to 3.77 MPa and the addition of wool fibre increases compression strength a 37\%. The potential benefit of stabilization was found to depend on the combinations of both stabilizer and wool fibre. Adding alginate and reinforcing with wool fibre doubles the soil compression resistance. Better results were obtained with a lower quantity of wool.},

The application of Additive Manufacturing (AM) bears the potential of increasing efficiency and shortening lead time by reducing processing steps, material use and labor intensity. The aim of this research is the exploration of AM technology potentials as a feasible and robust design and manufacturing solution for structural building elements. This research is based on the redesign of an existing node, applying the new production opportunities of AM. This resulted in insights into the different design steps involved and knowledge on process, costs and structural characteristics. The start was a topology optimization on an existing design for a structural node, followed by a further rationalized design for production. A comparison in aesthetics, structural behavior and costs has been carried out between the new design and the conventional design. The first results look very promising and the work will be continued to enable the use of these new opportunities in structural designs in the near future.},

  abstract = {The proliferation of data together with the increase of computing power in the last decade has triggered a new interest in artificial intelligence methods. Machine learning and in particular deep learning techniques, inspired by the topological structure of neurons network in brains, are omnipresent in the IT discourse, and generated new enthusiasms and fears in our society. These methods have already shown great effectiveness in fields far from architecture and have long been exploited in software that we use every day. Many computing libraries are available for anyone with some programming skills and allow them to "train" a neural network based on several types of data. The world of architecture has not remained external to this phenomenon: many researchers are working on the applications of artificial intelligence to architectural design, a few design software allow exploiting machine learning algorithms, and some large architectural firms have begun to experiment with deep learning methods to put into practice data accumulated over years of profession, with special interest in environmental sustainability and building performance. If on the one hand, these techniques promise great results, on the other we are still in an exploratory phase. It is then necessary, in our opinion, to understand what the roles of this technology could be within the architectural design process, and with which scopes they can facilitate such a complex profession as that of the architect. On this subject we made ten interviews with as many designers and researchers in the AEC industry, In the article we will report a summary of their testimonies, comparing and commenting on the responses of the designers, with the aim of understanding the potentials of using artificial intelligence methods within the design process, report their perceptions on how artificial intelligence techniques can affect the architect's approach to the project, concluding with some reflections on the critical issues identified during the interviews with the designers.},

In this paper we discuss some of the mechanical design challenges of developing a passive robotically-reconfigurable truss system, and present the concept of the factory floor, which can construct truss-like structures without climbing on them. In the proposed system, each level is constructed on a ground plane using a truss and node configuration and is elevated to make room for the next level. This process is repeated to create 3D truss structures or reversed to decompose the structure for the next task.},

This is in contrast to 3D printing technologies, which are finding applications in the aerospace and medical industries all the way through to jewellery and figurines. Despite the slow start for construction 3D printing there is however significant potential for these techniques within construction industry. Inquisitive and experimental designers are increasingly using sophisticated digital tools to develop complex 3D buildings and sculptural object designs, pushing the boundaries of what can be built. This is resulting in significant challenges for builders to fabricate and build these designs efficiently, especially with concrete. There is also a growing ethical and commercial requirement to create more with less, to use materials only where they are needed, to enable material recycling and to embed objects with greater capability. The FreeFab project is focused on shifting this paradigm with the development of a fabrication technique that produces energy efficient, low waste, fast and cost effective formwork. This chapter describes the development and testing of a novel robotically controlled wax 3D printing system and the software that drives it.},

Six case studies will be used as a demonstration of the method's ability to highlight those biases and how architects and designers manipulate those tools to translate their architectural expertise into algorithmic design. Those case studies are the six answers to the Seroussi Pavilion competition, organized in 2007 by Natalie Seroussi, a Parisian gallery owner. Having a keen interest into computational design, she invited six architectural practices specializing in this field. As the six case studies answer the same design brief, it represents a particularly suitable opportunity to analyse the intricate relationship between architectural constraints, their translation into computational data and instructions and the programming tools used to do so. Through the analysis of four different aspects of the project - algorithmic tools/method, computational set-up, organizational chart and architectural design - several issues of the computational turn in architecture are discussed.},

The research focuses on two aspects : a methodological approach for the constitution of a comprehensive history of the field and the application of that methodology to a corpus of items published in AD, and questions the relevance of the outlook into computational design as given by the magazine in comparison to a more comprehensive history taking into account other sources. First, the paper presents the history and the editorial line of AD magazine, as well as its pertinence as a primary source. Secondly, a brief account of the history emerging from this research is made, with a focus on four different periods : pioneering research of the 1960s-1970s, emergence of 3D modelling tools and procedural winter in the 1980s-1990s, constitution of a large-scale academic and professional network in the 2000s and democratisation of algorithmic design tools in the 2010s. Third, observations are made on editorial choices of the magazine and the biases of its account of computational research, with a special focus on the period 2000-2020, during which many issues have been dedicated to computational design themes, therefore making potential biases more visible. Despite the preponderance of specific topics, editors and contributors, AD magazine provides an outlook into key concerns of the community at given times. The main biases identified, including a strong focus on the themes of biodesign and rationalisation of practices, mirror the biases of the computational field itself, demonstrating the value of AD as an archive for the history of the field.},

  abstract = {With the digital revolution, new design methods appeared in architecture from the 1960s onwards, leading to a series of experimental projects, with the use of algorithms and programming tools as a common feature - a set of projects that can be grouped together under the common name of computational design. However, the use of a procedural, computational design process requires the development of a series of instructions that can be expressed in a formalised language, a process that at first sight contradicts the tacit knowledge on which architectural practice is based. The doctoral thesis proposes a three-level analysis of this series of projects and the use of programming tools for spatial design over the last 50 years. First, it seeks to characterise the computational field from a technical point of view: which algorithmic processes are used for architectural design and what technical biases do these processes entail? Secondly, the research looks at the socio-historical dimension of this current, focusing in particular on two approaches to procedural design: one favouring a rationalisation of architectural practices and the other choosing to explore the heuristic, artisanal side of the process, which is involved in mastering programming techniques. Finally, we question a possible epistemology of computational architecture based on the notions of know-how and calculability. The account of the historical development of the field sheds light on the epistemological choice of using algorithmic tools. To question computational practices is to question the nature of architecture as a discipline. The rationalisation of practices observed is based on an ambition to transform architectural practice into scientific practice. The popularisation of this approach is also based on a desire to conform to socio-economic constraints that are not always in line with the social ambitions that architects often place at the centre of their practice. The tacit dimension that some of the prospective experiments in the computational field attempt to capture is at the heart of the elusive definition of architecture, the reinterpretation of which by each practitioner is considered a characteristic aspect of the discipline. The formalisation that translation into explicit instructions requires can be seen as a methodological exploration of the design process. The cartography of the computational field and its stakes that the thesis proposes thus offers a privileged entry point into a reflection on the possibility of existence for an epistemology of architecture.}

The research explores in what regard multi-agent systems (MAS) are representative as much from the existence of these socio-technical networks as of how their development influences the tension between tacit and explicit knowledge at play in procedural design processes and of the strategies architectural designers develop to resolve this tension. A methodology of analysis of these phenomena is provided as well as results of the application of this method to MAS, leading to a better understanding of their development and impact in CAAD in the past two decades. Tactics of resolution shaped by early MAS users enable, through a double appropriation, a skillful implementation of architectural practice. Furthermore, their approach partially circumvents the establishment of technical biases tied to this algorithmic typology, at the cost of a lesser massive democratization of the algorithmic tools developed in relation to it.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, sustainable construction is a key factor for reaching net-zero emissions of carbon dioxide all over the world. This goal is impossible to achieve by merely reducing the energy consumption of end-users. A more holistic approach should be taken, adopting sustainable industrial practices that use environmentally friendly materials on a large scale. This paper presents the analysis of the hydrothermal properties of hemp thermal insulation plates. We carried out extensive measurements and the analysis of the thermal conductivity coefficient, drying-out dynamics, and water absorption. The study was performed with experimental insulation samples based on the fiber obtained from hemp stems, prepared using different adhesive powders. The dimensions of the analyzed samples were 300 × 300 mm. The proposed samples are not yet available in mass production. Hemp does not flower in the Baltic region and was traditionally used for soil regeneration. Thus, using this raw material increases the added value of agricultural residues. Three series of hemp fiber samples with different substances and pressing modes were evaluated in the study. Each set of samples consisted of four plates with varying thicknesses and two different densities: 200 kg/m3 and 300 kg/m3. All samples exhibited a significant increase in moisture absorption and a strong correlation with the increase in thermal conductivity. The average thermal conductivity of the test samples ranged from 0.0544 to 0.0594 W/mK. The impact of the adhesive powder on the thermal conductivity was found to be extremely small. However, the values obtained were much higher than those for traditional thermal insulation materials, allowing to utilize the local agriculture residues and providing material for the construction of eco-friendly buildings.},

This paper reports the results of an experimental investigation into the engineering properties, such as compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, drying shrinkage and creep, of polystyrene aggregate concrete varying in density. Factors such as water/cement ratio, polystyrene/cement ratio, cement content, maturity, compaction, fire, resistance. At the end of the study, a procedure for designing EPS light weight concrete mixes is outlined.},

  abstract = {Many algorithms have been proposed that create a path for a robot in an environment with obstacles. Most methods are aimed at finding a solution. However, for many applications, the path must be of a good quality as well. That is, a path should be short and should keep some amount of minimum clearance to the obstacles. Traveling along such a path reduces the chances of collisions due to the difficulty of measuring and controlling the precise position of the robot. This paper reports a new technique, called Partial shortcut, which decreases the path length. While current methods have difficulties in removing all redundant motions, the technique efficiently removes these motions by interpolating one degree of freedom at a time. Two algorithms are also studied that increase the clearance along paths. The first one is fast but can only deal with rigid, translating bodies. The second algorithm is slower but can handle a broader range of robots, including three-dimensional free-flying and articulated robots, which may reside in arbitrary high-dimensional configuration spaces. A big advantage of these algorithms is that clearance along paths can now be increased efficiently without using complex data structures and algorithms. Finally, we combine the two criteria and show that highquality paths can be obtained for a broad range of robots.},

  abstract = {This work addresses the problem of kinematic trajectory planning for mobile manipulators with non-holonomic constraints, and holonomic operational-space tracking constraints. We obtain whole-body trajectories and time-varying kinematic feedback controllers by solving a Constrained Sequential Linear Quadratic Optimal Control problem. The employed algorithm features high efficiency through a continuous-time formulation that benefits from adaptive step-size integrators and through linear complexity in the number of integration steps. In a first application example, we solve kinematic trajectory planning problems for a 26 DoF wheeled robot. In a second example, we apply Constrained SLQ to a real-world mobile manipulator in a receding-horizon optimal control fashion, where we obtain optimal controllers and plans at rates up to 100 Hz.}

With this in mind, the impact velocity distribution was investigated using a high-speed imaging system with a full-scale shotcrete spray generated using two dry-mix nozzles and one wet-mix nozzle. The incident velocity was found to be at its maximum in the central region around the spray axis and decrease toward the peripheral regions following a Gaussian-type function. Further analysis using normalized parameters shows that these velocity profiles, which were obtained experimentally, follow a similar function that can be used to compare the effect a given nozzle, or equipment, has on impact velocity distribution. In light of this work, innovative and unique characterization tools are proposed to further support equipment optimization and to improve the understanding of the overall shotcrete process, and especially rebound.},

In this field, the development of new fundamental and practical knowledge relies heavily on understanding the placement process, which controls the amount of rebound loss and consequently the in-place material composition and properties. In this context, an important experimental study investigating placement mechanisms at the process scale (spray scale) was undertaken and key findings are presented here. Indeed, the spatial distribution of the in-place sprayed material, around the spray axis, offers a unique view of the placement mechanisms; the effect of the spraying process is highlighted through the evaluation of the in-place material composition and distribution. In light of this study, a new approach is provided to initiate a thorough discussion on how shotcreting parameters and equipment can affect rebound losses and the quality of the in-place material.},

At the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, systematic research is done to develop the fully automated process control, focusing on the wet shotcrete method. With the development of the fully automated shotcrete robot, the user will have a very effective tool at his or her disposal to spray concrete shells (fully automated).

  abstract = {Buildings of the future are called to meet increasingly high-performance requirements and to ensure adequate environmental sustainability of the production and construction chain. This issue has stimulated a keen interest in the use of natural materials in construction. Among these, raw earth has proved to be particularly interesting for its intrinsic availability, sustainability, and recyclability. In Europe, the spread of raw earth building technologies has often been hindered by the lack of specific legislation regulating its use for load-bearing structures, even if in many countries, it can be noticed a widespread and well-established constructive tradition. Some transoceanic research experiences attest that unfired earth can be used, together with different types of reinforcements, to create seismic-resistant buildings. After presenting a review of the main raw earth reinforced technologies, the present study focuses on a novel reinforced and modular rammed earth construction made with natural or recycled materials, developing a technology with low energy consumption and low environmental impact, specifically designed for areas with high seismic risk. In particular, the work presents the results of a prototyping procedure aiming at developing a new seismicresistant construction system that combines rammed earth with timber reinforcement elements and nylon/polyester ropes. These elements have a dual function: (1) they are fundamental components of the construction process (as they integrate the formwork system), and (2) they act as seismic-resistant devices once the structure is completed. In line with the performance-based approach required by the construction sector, the study aims at defining a controlled and standardised supply chain for rammed earth construction.},

The study first described the methodology of producing a revised cob recipe for the purpose of 3D printing. Then, the study conducted thorough investigations into the properties of three types of extrusion systems using both electromechanical and pneumatic methods, leading eventually to the development of a new bespoke dual-ram extruder. The study then explored systematically the relationship between the new 3DP system and the rheological properties of cob, followed by an exploration to the new geometric opportunities the new system offers. The study findings show that the new extrusion system improves greatly the 3DP process of cob in terms of extrusion rate, continuity, consistency, and mobility. The findings are expected to bring 3D printed cob construction closer to full-scale applications. On a broader scale the study contributes to the disciplines of architectural design and construction by providing a framework capable of bridging the knowledge gap between vernacular modes of building production and contemporary digital practice.},

  abstract = {The rapid increase in the adoption rate of large-scale 3D printing into the construction industry has revealed a number of potential applications. This rapid implementation has also led to a higher degree of construction process optimisations and increased ability of mass customisation. Most existing applications of 3D printing technologies in construction are, however, heavily dependent on concrete and other cement-based materials, resulting in a pursuit to explore other building materials with lower environmental impact and higher adaptability to natural contexts. This pursuit has led to re-approaching earth materials and architecture to be applied in modern constructions. For centuries, earth architecture has offered potential solutions for several problems associated with buildings, such as high CO2 emissions, high embodied energy of the construction process, and depletion of natural resources. Yet this method of construction is possibly on the edge of extinction as its slow and very labourintensive process requires highly skilled craftsmen. Thanks to digital construction methods and technologies, earth materials can now become a key to promoting a new range of sustainable construction solutions that are adaptable to a local context. ‘Cob’ stands as one of many types of earth construction methods that has been utilised all over the world. Its mix consists of subsoil (earth), water, and fibrous material (typically straw), and its construction can comprise a variety of geometries and design goals without the need for formwork or any mechanical compaction method. The main aim of this research is to leverage the qualities of conventional cob construction as a groundwork for digital innovation through robotic-supported 3D printing (3DP) techniques. This aim has been approached through a comprehensive feasibility assessment of 3DP cob walls. The feasibility study included four main lines of exploration. First is the material fabrication and design process. In this line, the research systematically explored the relationship between the revised cob recipes and the geometrical and design characteristics offered by the new 3DP system. The findings of this exploration provide a new understanding about the opportunities and challenges of the current 3DP cob process, which becomes the basis to develop a novel 3DP system for earth-based materials. The second line examined the structural feasibility of using 3DP cob walls used in low-rise residential buildings. This investigation involved monotonic axial compression tests, in addition to a numerical modelling via Finite Element Analysis (FEA). The results proved the ability of 3DP cob load-bearing walls to support a two-storey residential house and meet building regulations. The test also established an optimised design chart, describing the relationship between building design and the loadbearing capacity of 3DP cob buildings. The third line of exploration involved investigating the thermal conductivity of 3DP cob walls. The assessment has revealed a lower thermal conductivity of 3D printed cob (as low as 0.32 W/mK) compared to its manually constructed cob counterparts, which means using 3DP cob for the building walls would potentially reduce heating and cooling energy use in the building. The fourth exploration focused on assessing the environmental impacts of 3DP cob walls using a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method, from cradle to site. The results showed a superior environmental performance of 3DP cob over the concrete-based construction methods while providing the same structural functionality in a onestory house. The results also indicate that the use of renewable energy resources can further boost the environmental potentials of 3DP cob for future construction. In summary, this research brings 3DP cob construction closer to full-scale applications. On a broader scale, the study contributes to the disciplines of architectural design and construction by providing a framework capable of bridging the knowledge gap between vernacular modes of architecture and contemporary digital practice. Moreover, this technology is not exclusive for new buildings as it can potentially be a useful strategy for conservation and repairing existing cob buildings. This is expected to benefit architects, designers and researchers currently looking into indigenous crafts as a source of material and design knowledge for a revisited digital-based architecture.}

However, these studies only present a coarse Life cycle Inventory (LCI) and often fail to detail all processes of the supply chain or to represent the co-products. This paper aims to bridge this gap and provide data for future LCAs on flax fiber production and transformation.The study focuses on the impacts of producing a bio-based reinforcement material (a fabric product for non-aesthetic purposes) with a system expansion perspective. The functional unit is defined as the production of 2400 m² flax-based technical textile per year, this corresponds to one hectare of cultivated land. The geographical scope considers that the production occurs in France and that some manufacturing process are outsourced in China. A Sensitivity Analysis was carried out to assess the influence of the electricity mix in the various countries involved in the manufacturing cycle.A detailed life cycle inventory for flax fiber production and transformation was built and the environmental performance of a flax technical textile was assessed as a cradle-to-gate LCA. The fate of co-products was documented and was shown to contribute to the reduction of the generated environmental impacts. Through a cradle-to-gate LCA, a broader understanding of the environmental performance of a flax-based technical textile was presented by including the valorization of co-products and a wider set of analyzed impact categories, going therefore beyond the existing state-of-the-art. Results show agricultural activities and electricity production to be the biggest contributors to the environmental impacts of flax technical textile; contributions due to land use changes were minor in comparison. Very specifically for this case study, a sensibility analysis showed the influence of an all-French production to be more efficient from an environmental point of view.},

  abstract = {Robot Tool Centre Point (TCP) calibration problem is of great importance for a number of industrial applications, and it is well known both in theory and in practice. Although various techniques have been proposed for solving this problem, they mostly require tool jogging or long processing time, both of which affect process performance by extending cycle time. This paper presents an innovative way of TCP calibration using a set of two cameras. The robot tool is placed in an area where images in two orthogonal planes are acquired using cameras. Using robust pattern recognition, even deformed tool can be identified on images, and information about its current position and orientation forwarded to control unit for calibration. Compared to other techniques, test results show significant reduction in procedure complexity and calibration time. These improvements enable more frequent TCP checking and recalibration during production, thus improving the product quality.},

  abstract = {This year's conference theme`Towards a new configurable architecture`, provides a good starting point for reappraising and reapplying previous concepts of Configuration' in architectural design. The concept reappears often, but was particularly powerful whenever new computational tools and architectural concepts emerged and revealed strong synergies. In the 1960ties there was such a moment when configuration's pluralistic properties embraced architectural concepts of structuralism and early computing. Therefore this paper looks back at previous concepts of configuration to identify capacities that could inform current synergies of computational tools, such as open platforms, and architectural concepts of the second digital turn in architecture. The way we communicate, access, and exchange information recently accelerated towards realtime sharing of data, bits \& pieces, and experiences. Open platforms that enable user-generated content and collective production of value are becoming more common in design. This paper discusses ways in which this collective content production can enable a computational and human-centric architecture, by reappraising previous concepts of configuration such as: open configurations, latent structures and variable infills.},

  abstract = {Reinforcement learning holds the promise of enabling autonomous robots to learn large repertoires of behavioral skills with minimal human intervention. However, robotic applications of reinforcement learning often compromise the autonomy of the learning process in favor of achieving training times that are practical for real physical systems. This typically involves introducing hand-engineered policy representations and human-supplied demonstrations. Deep reinforcement learning alleviates this limitation by training general-purpose neural network policies, but applications of direct deep reinforcement learning algorithms have so far been restricted to simulated settings and relatively simple tasks, due to their apparent high sample complexity. In this paper, we demonstrate that a recent deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on offpolicy training of deep Q-functions can scale to complex 3D manipulation tasks and can learn deep neural network policies efficiently enough to train on real physical robots. We demonstrate that the training times can be further reduced by parallelizing the algorithm across multiple robots which pool their policy updates asynchronously. Our experimental evaluation shows that our method can learn a variety of 3D manipulation skills in simulation and a complex door opening skill on real robots without any prior demonstrations or manually designed representations.},

However the strength of this material is really fluctuating as a consequence of soil’s variability and the different methods that are used in vernacular earth construction. The aim of this study is to identify the mechanisms that increase the strength of this material. The optimization of the processing method of raw earth’s blocks is sought in order to get better strengths systematically for different sorts of soils. All of these soils are extracted from the same region, Brittany, in order to insist on the local character of this material. For three sorts of soils from Brittany this study will focus on four different processing methods: casting, compaction, vibro-compaction and extrusion. These soils will be mixed with water only or water and Sodium-hexametaphosphate which acts as a dispersant. The rheological behaviour of each soil will be adapted to the different processing methods. The fact that, for earth-based materials, the compressive strength at the dry state depends on its dry density will be shown. Thus it will be displayed that the processing method, and the use of dispersant that allows to reduce the water content during the processing, can be efficient to enhance the dry density and consequently the compressive strength of all of the selected soils. Those strategies are also efficient to improve the process robustness for ensuring high levels of compressive strength and dry density for raw earth construction. This study highlights that some of these methods could be used soon at a semi-industrial scale, to produce a structural material that needs to achieve compliance with modern standards without hydraulic binders.},

Among them, earthen materials have a strong potential to be used as sustainable structural materials but their variability and their water sensitivity impact their mechanical properties that are difficult to guaranty. Recent developments have emphasised the ability of some bio-based additions to help to ensure these properties: linseed oil and xanthan gum are part of them. In this paper three different Breton earths, representative of a certain local variability, are studied. The impact of the selected bio-based additions on earths’ rheological behaviour is followed in order to adapt it to different forming processes. Then, the mechanical properties of different earth-addition combinations at the dry state, exposed to hygric variations and immersion are investigated for different forming processes. The findings highlight the fact that xanthan gum and linseed oil have a relevant ability to stabilise earthen blocks, that can be processed using different promising forming methods.},

  abstract = {Analysis of the results obtained from material simulations is important in the physical sciences. Our research was motivated by the need to investigate the properties of a simulated porous solid as it is hit by a projectile. This paper describes two techniques for the generation of distance fields containing a minimal number of topological features, and we use them to identify features of the material. We focus on distance fields defined on a volumetric domain considering the distance to a given surface embedded within the domain. Topological features of the field are characterized by its critical points. Our first method begins with a distance field that is computed using a standard approach, and simplifies this field using ideas from Morse theory. We present a procedure for identifying and extracting a feature set through analysis of the MS complex, and apply it to find the invariants in the clean distance field. Our second method proceeds by advancing a front, beginning at the surface, and locally controlling the creation of new critical points. We demonstrate the value of topologically clean distance fields for the analysis of filament structures in porous solids. Our methods produce a curved skeleton representation of the filaments that helps material scientists to perform a detailed qualitative and quantitative analysis of pores, and hence infer important material properties. Furthermore, we provide a set of criteria for finding the “difference” between two skeletal structures, and use this to examine how the structure of the porous solid changes over several timesteps in the simulation of the particle impact.},

Data were gathered from automotive suppliers by the use of interviews and a questionnaire. The survey showed, that most of the problems with product data exchange between suppliers and customers relate to different organizational patterns for product development. Four types of suppliers are presented, each having specific requirements according to product development organization and product data exchange. STEP, which applies to the technical problems with product data exchange, can only be used effectively when the organizational problems with product development processes have been triggered.},

Composites and in particular fiber reinforced polymers (FRP) are increasingly present in concrete reinforcement. Their corrosion resistance, high tensile strength, low weight, and high flexibility offer an interesting alternative to conventional steel reinforcement, especially with respect to their use in Concrete 3D Printing. This paper presents an initial development of a dynamic robot-based manufacturing process for FRP concrete reinforcement as an innovative way to increase shape freedom and efficiency in concrete construction. The focus here is on prefabricated fiber reinforcement, which is concreted in a subsequent additive process to produce load-bearing components. After the presentation of the fabrication concept for the integration of FRP reinforcement and the state of the art, a requirements analysis regarding the mechanical bonding behavior in concrete is carried out. This is followed by a description of the development of a dynamic fiber winding process and its integration into an automated production system for individualized fiber reinforcement. Next, initial tests for the automated application of concrete by means of Shotcrete 3D Printing are carried out. In addition, an outlook describes further technical development steps and provides an outline of advanced manufacturing concepts for additive concrete manufacturing with integrated fiber reinforcement.},

  abstract = {The research project Mesh Mould explores the unification of formwork and reinforcement into one single, robotically fabricated construction system. An industrial robot is used to spatially “weave” a three-dimensional mesh, which acts as porous formwork during the process of concrete pouring, and is activated as reinforcement after the concrete has cured. In a first project phase a three-dimensional polymer extrusion process was developed allowing quickly assessing a wide range of mesh patterns and subsequently establishing an appropriate relationship of mesh morphology and concrete rheology. Whereas in the first phase, the loadbearing capacity of the polymer meshes was only of minor concern, the second phase of the project deliberately focuses on the structural performance of the meshes. Therefor an automated robotic wire bending and welding tool for steel meshes was prototypically developed, systematically tested and is currently undergoing further cycles of development. Concurrently a series of structurally differentiated metal meshes was fabricated semi-automatically and tested in destructive load tests. Particularly well performing mesh typologies subsequently inform the design of the next iteration of the robotic wire bending and welding manipulator. As such, the research aims to develop a fully automated in-situ robotic fabrication process for geometrically complex, loadbearing concrete constructions.},

On the genotypic side, a variable length representation is used: the complexity of the representation of each individual is evolved by the algorithm rather than being prescribed by some fixed mesh of the design domain, resulting in self-adaptive complexity. On the phenotypic side, an original adaptive mechanism is proposed that maintains both feasible and infeasible individuals, thus exploring both sides of the boundary of the feasible region, where the optimum structure is known to lie. Not only does this improves the results of past work in on Evolutionary Topological Optimum Design on standard benchmark bidimensional cantilever problems, but it also allows to address three-dimensional problems who had up to now stayed beyond reach for evolutionary algorithms. 1 Introduction Early works on adaptivity in the framework of Evolutionary Algorithms (...},

Considered optimization criteria are the minimization of both the mass of the structure and its maximal displacement under a prescribed loading. Multi-objective evolutionary algorithm using Voronoi representation are applied on the cantilever plate, the popular benchmark problems of TOD. The results are discussed in the light of the single objective approaches used in previous works: whereas the quality of the result is very similar, the number of Finite Element Analyzes needed to obtain a full set of trade-off structures by the multi-objective method is more or less the same that needed to obtain only one solution using a single-objective algorithm with a limit on the maximal displacement: This makes multi-objective approach extremely interesting for solving real life TOD problems where the evaluation cost is usually quite high while the possibility of making of a well justified choice of definitive design is very important.},

Dierent compact unstructured representations are introduced, the complexity of which is self-adaptive, i.e. is evolved by the algorithm itself. The Voronoibased representations are variable length lists of alleles that are directly decoded into shapes, while the IFS representation, based on fractal theory, involves a much more complex morphogenetic process.}

This paper focuses on Topological Optimum Design problems: early results have shown the ability of Evolutionary methods to find numerical solutions to yet unsolved problems, but those approaches were limited because the complexity of the representation was that of a fix ed underlying mesh. Different new representations, both unstructured and compact, are introduced: their complexity is self-adaptive, i.e. is evolved by the algorithm itself.

We restrict to stochastic optimization methods such as Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs): they do not require any a priori assumption about the function to optimize (or about the constraints) and they are able to tackle optimization problems on different kinds of search spaces. The most crucial step when constructing an EA is the choice of representation, which determines the search space. In order to overcome limitation of previous works, a new representation is presented, termed Voronoi representation, which is independent of any priori discretization. Moreover, constraints are accounted for through penalty function, and a new adaptive penalty method is proposed to explore the neighborhood of the boundary of the feasible region. The results of TOD of standard benchmark 2-D cantilever problems are improved. Further, this approach allows to address 3-D problems, on which it demonstrates its ability to find multiple quasi-optimal solutions.},

Comparisons were drawn across four levels of granularity. The findings are twofold: 1) blockchain improved information completeness and information accuracy respectively by an average 216\% and 261\% compared with the digital state-of-practice solution. The improvements were significantly more pronounced for inquiries that had higher product, trade, and temporal granularity; 2) blockchain-enabled solution was robust in the face of increased granularity, while the conventional solution experienced 50\% and 66.7\% decline respectively in completeness and accuracy of information.

  abstract = {The construction industry has long been plagued with late and non-payments. Despite the desired benefits of payment automation and today's increased access to digitized progress data, too often payment applications still rely on inefficient workflows and documents that are time-consuming to prepare, review, approve, and execute. This paper argues that current payment applications, even if computerized, cannot support reliable automation of progress payments due to their reliance on centralized control mechanisms and lack of guaranteed execution. The paper examines why blockchain-based and decentralized smart contracts can address these limitations. It explores the conceptual underpinning for the design of an automated payment system and investigates the role of smart contracts in enabling reliable and autonomous conditioning of cash flow on product flow status. To illustrate these points, a use case is presented for smart contract-based progress payments in the context of unmanned aerial vehicle-based progress monitoring. The paper concludes with a discussion of challenges facing blockchain-based payment automation and the broader implications for dispute resolution and construction law informatics, namely zero-trust computing and the creation of an auditable single source of truth for projects.},

We can imagine the shapes of 3D objects and reason about their spatial relations by merely looking at their three-view line drawings in 2D, with different levels of competence. Can deep networks be trained to perform spatial reasoning tasks? How can we measure their "spatial intelligence"? To answer these questions, we present the SPARE3D dataset. Based on cognitive science and psychometrics, SPARE3D contains three types of 2D-3D reasoning tasks on view consistency, camera pose, and shape generation, with increasing difficulty. We then design a method to automatically generate a large number of challenging questions with ground truth answers for each task. They are used to provide supervision for training our baseline models using state-of-the-art architectures like ResNet. Our experiments show that although convolutional networks have achieved superhuman performance in many visual learning tasks, their spatial reasoning performance in SPARE3D is almost equal to random guesses. We hope SPARE3D can stimulate new problem formulations and network designs for spatial reasoning to empower intelligent robots to operate effectively in the 3D world via 2D sensors.

This paper presents an original algorithm for adaptively decomposing a STL model into a set of variable slices, which can be efficiently fabricated by ALHC system. A large complex model is first partitioned into several smaller and simpler sub-models by using the curvature-based partitioning.

One hundred thousand years ago, at least six different species of humans inhabited Earth. Yet today there is only one--homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us? Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas .Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become?

It enables architects to explicitly account for the assembly process already during the design phase, and enables efficient building methods that profit from the robots' different capabilities. Previous work has addressed planning of robot assembly sequences and identifying the feasibility of architectural designs. This paper extends previous work by enabling assembly planning with large, heterogeneous teams of robots. We present a scalable planning system which enables parallelization of complex task and motion planning problems by iteratively solving smaller sub-problems. Combining optimization methods to solve for manipulation constraints with a sampling-based bi-directional space-time path planner enables us to plan cooperative multi-robot manipulation with unknown arrival-times. Thus, our solver allows for completing sub-problems and tasks with differing timescales and synchronizes them effectively. We demonstrate the approach on multiple case-studies and on two long-horizon building assembly scenarios to show the robustness and scalability of our algorithm.},

On the one hand, they live up to certain common scientific and methodological criteria - originality and transparency – and on the other hand, they have different practices, using different methods. Research is ‘coloured’ by traditions and professions, and research in architecture should be coloured too, taking into consideration that the practice of architects stretches from natural science and sociology to art and that the most important way in which the architect achieves new cognition is through work with form and space – drawings, models and completed works. Probably all good design is informed by some kind of research – research-based design. But can research arise from design?},

Continuity and smoothness should be attained if possible, but otherwise the volume of the discontinuity boundary should be minimized. A sampling-based approximation technique is presented that uses discretized roadmaps of both the domain and image, and minimizes discontinuities of the inverse function. The method is applied to kinematic redundancy resolution for redundant robots, which have more degrees of freedom than workspace dimensions. The output is a global redundancy resolution, which has the convenient property that whenever the robot returns to the same workspace point, it uses the same joint-space pose. If a global resolution cannot be found, then the method minimizes discontinuities and maps them in workspace. Results are demonstrated on toy problems with up to 20 DOF, and on several robot arms.},

  abstract = {Sustainability is to become the guiding principle of social action and economic activity. At the same time, its ways and means are far from clear. As a holistic praxis, sustainability must combine technical and material as well as social, economic, ecological and also ethical strategies, which have multiple complex interactions and all too often also conflicting goals and priorities. In no other field can these be better observed, addressed and influenced than in architecture and building. Each volume of “Building Better – Less – Different” details two fundamental areas of sustainability and explores their specific dynamics and interactions. After introductory overviews, innovative methods and current developments are described and analysed in in-depth essays, international case studies and pointed commentaries. The sustainability criteria of efficiency (“better’”), sufficiency (“less”‘) and consistency (‘different”) form the framework for each book. The first volume “CIRCULAR BUILDING AND CIRCULAR ECONOMY” presents concepts, methods and examples of circularity in construction and the economy. Urban mining and circular construction are two approaches to the changes that architecture and urban design are facing, using techniques such as mono-material construction and design for disassembly, and tools such as material passports and databases. The circular economy is not solely about recycling but encompasses a wide range of strategies from local community projects to new ownership and service models and steering mechanisms such as carbon fees and dividends.

While identifying potential areas for in-situ fabrication in the construction sector, the intention is also to build upon innovative man-machine interaction paradigms to deal with the imprecision and tolerances often faced on construction sites. By combining the precision of the machine with the innate cognitive human skills, a simple but effective mobile fabrication system is tested for the building of algorithmically designed structures that would not be possible through conventional manual means. It is believed that this new approach to manmachine collaboration, aimed at a deeper integration of human ability with the strengths of digitally controlled machines, will result in advances in the construction sector, thus opening up new design and application fields for architects and planners.},

  abstract = {Thin-walled glass fibre reinforced concrete (GFRC) panels are being used as the primary cladding material on many landmark buildings especially in the last decade. GFRC is an ideal material for building envelopes because it is durable, it can resist fire and the environmental impact is low compared to other materials, because the base materials used in the production of GFRC are widely available throughout the world. Thin-walled GFRC was initially developed as a cladding material in the 1970s and 1980s where the majority of the available research lies.~The introduction of 3D CAD software has enabled the design of buildings with complex shapes that, in the past, would have been rationalised to meet budget and time constraints. However, when GFRC has been proposed for buildings with a complex free-form geometry it has been replaced with alternative materials such as glass reinforced plastic (GFRP) due to the high cost and time required to fabricate suitable GFRC panels using conventional manufacturing methods. The literature showed that empirical performance characterization of GFRC had not been researched in detail regarding the limits of functionality or any systematic approach to understanding their use in complex geometry building envelopes.As a first step the key architectural demands, the main barriers and limitations in the manufacture of complex geometry thin-walled GFRC were identified by interviewing and visiting manufacturers, designers and key buildings. This identified the key barrier to be the process of producing the mould for casting the complex geometry GFRC panels. Solutions to resolve them were tested over several stages for each of the main production methods most suited for the manufacture of thin-walled GFRC, namely; the automated premixed method, the premixed method and the sprayed method. The results from the laboratory testing over all the stages, and the prototype structure manufactured with the identified solution from the testing, answered the main research question:How can the manufacture of complex geometry thin-walled GFRC be advanced to meet today’s architectural demands?So, the architectural demands for thin-walled GFRC cladding were identified, together with a clearly defined range of complexity of thin-walled GFRC panels. The key demands were; a smooth surface texture, no visual fibres in the surface, minimal air-bubbles or voids, consistent colour across all thin-walled GRFC elements, no visible cracks, and the need for edge-returns and panel offsets. The suitability of selected production methods were evaluated against these demands. Firstly the automated premixed method was tested on a flexible table, (single reconfigurable mould surface, with computer controlled actuators~ capable of forming free-formed geometries). This showed that the flexible table alone would not meet the requirements for an edge-return, with the manufacturing speed required, to produce many unique shaped panels within normal building project time-schedules. Following this test a solution was proposed that used the flexible table to produce free-formed shaped moulds using fast curing foam, enabling moulds to be produced within hours allowing more rapid utilization of the flexible table.~This solution was first tested for the premixed method by casting positive and negative mould parts enabling an edge-return to be cast because flexible tables are only able to produce moulds with a continuous surface. The new mould solution for complex geometry shapes also demonstrated that it was difficult to avoid air-bubbles and voids when casting the GFRC panels using the premixed method. So a second mould solution was developed for the sprayed method. This resolved the challenges of forming an edge-barrier on the mould, while allowing an edge-return to be successfully cast on a double curved panel that met the key architectural demands.From the research and the tests it was possible to devise a fully automated process for the manufacture of complex geometry thin-walled GFRC, comprised of:– Stage 1: Initial architectural geometric concept.  – Stage 2: Panelization and geometric offsetting.  – Stage 3: Identifying the right production method.  – Stage 4: Casting process. – Stage 5: Transportation and Installation.Solutions for each of these stages all contributed to advances that will enable current and future free-form thin-walled GFRC architectural designs to be realised.The contribution to knowledge from the tests and the resulting automated process was used to produce the moulds for 9 unique double curved elements to form each row of a 10m tall self-supporting thin-walled shell. This show-cased how the identified solution enabled a faster and more cost effective method to produce free-form thin-walled GFRC panels. One of the main conclusions of the research showed that the sprayed method currently provides most flexibility in the manufacture of complex geometry thin-walled GFRC panels when the identified architectural demands must be met.~To advance the manufacture of complex geometry thin-walled panels further a fully automated and digital manufacturing process must be developed. As identified in the research this can be done by upgrading current automated premixed production lines by integrating the new solution for complex geometry shaped moulds into the production line and automatically spaying the GFRC onto the mould.When fully developed this fully automated method would enable free-form shell elements to be produced, that may also incorporate insulation, allowing segments for a self-supporting free-form shell to be constructed.~With this research the current architectural knowledge base has been advanced in terms of complex geometry thin-walled GFRC for building envelopes. The identified solutions should allow building with complex geometries to be realised using thin-walled GFRC as the envelope cladding.},

  abstract = {Complex geometry concrete is being used in building and infrastructure projects, however costly in-situ mouldings are necessary to achieve these geometries. Advancing discretised concrete shell structures requires the development of a new moulding system at lower cost and reduced mould production times. Future thin-walled glass fibre reinforced concrete (GFRC) elements must possess good surface quality, with the required edge returns and offsets, combined with the physical material properties to increase spans and lower the risk of visible surface cracks. Existing moulding systems do not have the capability to meet these contemporary architectural aesthetic and design aspirations. A new mould system to produce freeform thin-walled GFRC elements is presented and can be used to replace CNC milled moulds for the manufacture of thin walled GFRC. Such a system allows the mould for thin-walled GFRC elements to be produced in a fast, cost effective and more efficient manner. A step-by-step process to achieve such thinwalled GFRC panels is described permitting the fabrication of complex geometry thin-walled GFRC elements using more cost effective large-scale production methods. This process bridges the gap between the limited capabilities of current solutions and the architectural aesthetic demands for good surface quality, with the option of having an edge-return of the same surface quality as the front surface to give a monolithic appearance.},

This paper presents a proposal for an adaptive and flexible design system that facilitates the design and production processes of complex geometry walls. The system allows for intuitive control ofparametric design configurations whilst providing an easy-to-use code for robotic fabrication. The paper describes the worliflow of a digital design and fabrication experiment: a double curved parametric wall designed and realized out of individual, stackable EPS (expanded polystyrene) elements. The example illustrates how the worliflow is customizable, allowing the user to manipulate the wall design in a feedback loop method. The continuously varying geometry is driven by a bitmap pattern that defines the aesthetics of the external wall surface and potentially optimizes the building performances from a structural and energetic standpoint. The paper subsequently anticipates the future development of the research in terms of mechanical cutting tools, material component behavior, fabrication constraints, and their associated impact on building geometry and design.},

  abstract = {Motivated by increasing application in contemporary architectural projects, we showcase a unique state-ofthe-art industrial process, which encompasses design and fabrication offree-form metal cladding for large doubly curved roofs and facades. The technology combines well-established methods of metal roofing with a completely digital workflow - starting from a 3D scan of the building, following with the approximation of the design surface as set of developable stripes and ending with the automated CNC-jabrication of individually curved panels from aluminium or steel coils. Since projects often require panel shapes and lengths, which are difficult to transport, the production units are mobile and can be shipped in two standard intermodal containers, enabling fabrication directly on-site. Geometrically, the system is based on tightly packed developable strips with non-parallel edges. Technically, it leads to a homogeneous, watertight and continuous surface without penetrations, which is easy to mount on a multitude of structural systems and thereby resolves the common problems that occur, when cladding doubly curved surfaces. The entire process has been successfully tested and proven on a number of large-scale projects, ofwhich some are illustrated.},

Based on the given dead load of the slab and the topology of the supporting structure, this method allows formfinding ofsupport structures that are in equilibrium with axial compression forces only. During the form-finding process, the resulting horizontal forces from the compression support structure are balanced through translation and rotation of the slab, and subsequently resolved in the plane of the slab using funicular or trussed strut-and-tie systems. The presented method can be applied for the design of a variety of different typologies of supporting structures, such as inclined columns, curved walls, branching structures and shells. A computational prototype of the approach is implemented as CAD modeling tool, and the potential of the method is shown through two formal design explorations.},

In two full-scale experiments, grid shell structures have been designed and built at Aarhus School of Architecture and the University of Technology, Sydney, in 2011 and 2012. The novel design method is described as an iterative process, negotiating both physical and digital constraints. This involves consideration of the relations between geometry and technique, as well as the use of form-finding and simulation algorithms for shaping and optimising the shape of the structure. Custom-made scripts embedded in 3D-modeling tools were used for producing the information necessary for realising the construction comprised of discrete concrete elements.},

  abstract = {The use of fibres as reinforcement of 3D printed concrete is widely known and applicable in many situations. However, most of the applied fibres are not produced from renewable resources. Natural fibres are commonly considered as an ecological alternative for these fibres. In order to contribute to improvement of the sustainability of 3D printed concrete, natural fibres such as hemp can replace these synthetic fibres. The objective of this study is therefore to study the possibilities of adding hemp fibres for 3D printing purposes. Due to the comparable properties of hemp and synthetic fibres, natural fibres tend to be suitable for printing purposes. Mixes are made at laboratory scale using batches of 1 – 3 kg. The study examines the effect of adding hemp fibres for the mechanical and fresh state properties of hemp-based concrete. Mechanical properties from bending tests and direct tensile tests show comparable properties of mortars containing hemp fibres and mortars containing synthetic fibres. The fresh state behaviour of the designed concrete mix showed promising and comparable results for a mix based on 0.5wt\% of hemp fibres. One of the major issues regarding the use of natural fibres is the irregularity and high water uptake of the fibres. Due to its high hydrophilicity natural hemp fibres take up much water and can therefore degrade. For this study the effect of water uptake did not have much influence on the mixing and printing purposes. By printing a wall element on laboratory scale the use of hemp fibre-reinforced 3D concrete is validated.},

  abstract = {In the last decade the use of earth in construction has become increasingly widespread in many countries. Building with earth can contribute to sustainable development by reducing environmental impact compared with other building materials or systems. This new consciousness has given rise to a growth in the number of earth building standards in recent years although, in absolute terms, the number is very small compared with other typical building materials and systems. Forty different earth building standards coming from 20 different countries were examined. The standards provide varying degrees of technical information. With regard to their scope of application, the documents can be classified into three types, each of them dealing with a particular aspect: soil classification, earth building materials, earth construction systems. In Germany, a revival of building with earth first came about in the 1980s as an awareness of ecological criteria grew. A product of this development was the elaboration of an earth building standard, the “Lehmbau Regeln” by the Dachverband Lehm e. V., the German national earth building association. That part of the “Lehmbau Regeln” concerning earth blocks and earth mortars was adapted to the circumstances of national DIN/European building codes and published in August 2013 as DIN 18945–47. A new DIN 18948 “Earth boards” will be issued in 2019. The four DINs were elaborated for industrially produced, chemically non-stabilized earth building materials.},

  abstract = {The need for rapid, cost-effective and finish-less manufacturing of large sized, sculptured, physical models from various soft materials is increasing in several fields. For objects fabricated from plastic foams an advantageous approach is free-form, thick-layered manufacturing. Although it is technologically demanding, to achieve the best results (a) computer definition of the geometry has to be accurate, (b) the geometric model has to be directly sliced, (c) higher order approximation of the nominal shape is necessary, and (d) a quasi-free-form working out of the front surfaces of the layers is needed. The authors have developed the mathematical and/or technological fundamentals and process of free-form cutting based on heated flexible blades. The shape and the relative positions of the flexible blade are controlled continually as needed by the normal curvatures of the front faces of the layers. The paper elaborates on the computation methods for physically-based and geometrically-based modeling of flexible blades. The algorithms for approximating curve generation and curve matching are also presented. The paper extends to some of the most important aspects of the global thick-layered fabrication process.},

The authors have been developing a new prototyping technology which is the most appropriate for layered fabrication of objects of volumes bigger than 0.6 m 3. The new technology is based on (a) an electronically controlled and mechanically set hot flexible blade as an easy-to-deform cutting tool, (b) direct slicing of the CAD model (c) generation of the actual tool profile by calculating the best fitting approximation curve to the nominal shape by the principle of minimum strain energy, (d) calculation of the tool position and the tool path by the principle of maximum positional compensation, and (e) the use of a machining equipment of high kinematic degrees of freedom. This paper presents the computation algorithms and the program for a geometrically-based calculation of the profile curve of the tool, together with those for slicing and cusp reduction. Finally, algorithms for tool position and tool path calculation are presented.

We show that both of these can be formulated as special cases of a generalized localization problem. In the standard localization problem, the aim is to determine the pose of some object (usually a mobile robot) relative to a global coordinate system. In our generalized version, the aim is to determine the pose of all elements in a network (both fixed and mobile) relative to an arbitrary global coordinate system. We have developed a physically inspired ‘meshbased’ formalism for solving such problems. This paper outlines the formalism, and describes its application to the concrete tasks of multi-robot mapping and calibration of a distributed sensor network. The paper presents experimental results for both tasks obtained using a set of Pioneer mobile robots equipped with scanning laser range-finders.},

Based on an imperative programming language, DiffTaichi generates gradients of simulation steps using source code transformations that preserve arithmetic intensity and parallelism. A light-weight tape is used to record the whole simulation program structure and replay the gradient kernels in a reversed order, for end-to-end backpropagation. We demonstrate the performance and productivity of our language in gradient-based learning and optimization tasks on 10 different physical simulators. For example, a differentiable elastic object simulator written in our language is 4.2× shorter than the hand-engineered CUDA version yet runs as fast, and is 188× faster than the TensorFlow implementation. Using our differentiable programs, neural network controllers are typically optimized within only tens of iterations.},

We used the programming language Java to create machine instructions for 3D printers, milling machines, and robots. In this method, design and production are not two separated processes; rather we regarded them as two aspects of one whole activity.

Weierstrass parameterization is employed to define minimal surfaces (R3) over a complex plane (C). Our method consists of three components. First, the orthogonal double-sided cuts match a pair of orthonormal tangent vectors on the surface. Second, A closed-form expression for the principal directions facilitates the global quadrangulation of minimal surfaces. Third, the CNC machine’s toolpath results from the surface’s analytic characterization. Asymptotic cutting and principal cutting are compared in terms of collisions and cutting error. We employed a general-purpose language (Java) to create machine instructions from the Weierstrass representation of minimal surfaces. Thus, the entire workflow from mathematical modeling to production involves no 3D models or CAD/CAM software. Both a 5-axis wire cutter and a customized robotic system were tested.},

  author = {Huerta, Santiago},
  pages = {24},
  abstract = {The theory of masonry structures should take into account the essentials of the material "masonry": heterogeneity, good compressive strength, almost no resistance to tension, and a high friction coefficient. Besides, it should be appropriated to the usual structural type of old masonry buildings, i.e., vaulted structures with massive buttresses. Finally, it should consider that cracks are present in most masonry buildings and that these cracks may vary with time. From the end of the seventeenth century a "scientific" theory of vaulted masonry structures has been developed. Professor Heyman has incorporated this "old" theory of masonry structures within the broader frame of modern Limit Analysis. This scientific theory was preceded by another: the traditional "geometrical" theory of the old master builders. Both theories tried to solve the fundamental problem of structural design: to design safe structures, i.e., to understand what makes an structure safe (or unsafe). Both theories arrive to same conclusion: the safety of a masonry structure 0is a matter of geometry. A safe state of equilibrium is achieved through a correct geometry. Both historically and theoretically the "equilibrium approach" is the best approach to the analysis and design of masonry structures.},

It is well known that Gaudi used hanging models and graphical methods as design tools. These methods can be traced back to the end of the 17th Century. In addition, it was not original the use of equilibrated, catenarian forms. What was completely original was the idea of basing all the structural design in considerations of equilibrium. Gaudi also employed unusual geometrical forms for some of his vaults and ruled surfaces, showing a deep structural insight. Finally, he designed tree-forms of equilibrium for the supports of the vaults in the Sagrada Familia. In the present paper Gaudi's equilibrium methods are studied with some detail, stressing their validity within the frame of Limit Analysis.},

When performed with a general 6-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) manipulator, there exists one DOF of redundancy that remains. By taking advantage of the symmetry axis of the welding electrode, the authors decompose the required instantaneous twist of the electrode into two orthogonal components, one lying into the relevant task subspace and one into the redundant task subspace, respectively. Joint-limits and singularity avoidance are considered as the optimization objectives.},

  abstract = {The increased prevalence of storm surge events that cause extreme erosion in coastal environments points to the delicate balance that exists in the perpetual formation processes of dunes. While coastal defence structures and traditional beach nourishment strategies can alleviate some of the damaging force of ongoing wave action, they don't provide a lasting solution and often produce undesirable side-effects. Design authority in this contested area of landscape transformation is often limited to engineers and shaped by reductionist economic or risk management factors. Through investigations in digital landscape fabrication techniques, this paper reconsiders the role of design in these evolving systems while demonstrating the potential for on-site, adaptive, and dynamic construction processes. By creating resilience through adaptive topographies of natural granular material, this paper proposes to establish a new equilibrium between natural processes and robotic earth-moving strategies. By combining a wave tank with natural beach sand, computational modelling and robotic beach sand manipulations, emergent topologies and open-ended design proposals are enabled under the continuous influence of water movements. The experiments were conducted in a two-week international masterclass at the School of Architecture, University of Technology, Sydney, where adaptive feedback systems for coastal remediation were studied in relation to the Northern Beaches of Sydney. As such, this paper presents a novel coastal design approach towards autonomous construction in dynamic environments, combining various technologies to generate new paths of research and design investigation.},

  abstract = {Rammed-earth (RE) structures are becoming popular because of their sustainability, environment-friendly, and economic advantages. Various studies have investigated the mechanical behavior and energy performance of rammed-earth materials. However, little is known about their fracture behavior. In this study, the fracture properties of RE materials containing different percentages of various stabilizers were investigated using a modified wedge splitting test (WST). The stabilizers were cement, pozzolan, microsilica, glass fiber, guar gum, and phase change material (PCM). Additionally, the effects of these stabilizers on microstructure and phase composition were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), respectively. The results indicated that cement and pozzolan, depending on the pozzolanic reaction, increased the strength of the microstructure while glass fibers led to internal confinement and high ductility that increased the fracture energy of RE materials. However, the phase change material and guar gum reduced the strength and fracture energy of the RE materials. Finally, a statistically significant correlation was obtained between specific fracture energy and other mechanical properties, pointing the way to proper approaches to improve crack resistance of rammed-earth materials.},

Past work has assumed low-level capabilities appropriate to computing agents but not necessarily to biology. Here I discuss potential ways of implementing low-level primitives based on capabilities for which evidence exists in biological systems, with the goal of developing a basis for engineering developmental processes that will be realizable in wetware. I focus on the use of biologically realistic morphogen gradients to produce structures of desired size, provide positional information, and trigger genetic cascades that lead to the growth of more complex structures.},

The paper focuses on the contextual aspects and the working principles of AIMM. Furthermore, the paper deals with the design principles and overall hardware and software architectures of “Little Helper” from a functional and modular mechatronics point of view, in order to create a generic AIMM platform. The design challenges faced in the project is to integrate commercial off‐the‐shelf (COTS) and dedicated highly integrated systems into an autonomous mobile manipulator system with the ability to perform diverse tasks in industrial environments. We propose an action based domain specific communication language for AIMM for routine and task definition, in order to lower the entry barriers for the users of the technology. To demonstrate the “Little Helper” concept a full‐scale prototype has been built and different application examples carried out. Experiences and knowledge gained from this show promising results regarding industrial integration, exploitation and maturation of the AIMM technology.},

The assets of the Shotcrete 3D Printing include excellent layer bonding, the possibility to embed structural reinforcement during printing, as well as the extended geometric freedom which allows printing cantilevers and overhangs without the necessity to use additional support structures (see Gradual Transition Shotcrete 3D Printing). Moreover, the initially rough surfaces can be automatically trowel in order to create smooth high-quality concrete finishes.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a method for the construction of non-uniform precast concrete shell structures from unique parts. A novel method of discontinuous post-tensioning is introduced which allows tension to be taken through the connections. This increases the formal possibilities of the system beyond compression-only funicular forms. It also allows live loading to be catered for without significant thickening of the structure. Most significantly, the post-tensioning system allows for an almost total elimination of falsework a significant impediment to the realistion of complex shell structures. This advancement reduces resources needed for assembly, and increases the overall robustness of the system. Also presented are a series of refinements that add to the geometric precision of individual concrete elements cast in lasercut PET moulds. These include the development of a casting rig used to fix casting moulds in the right position during casting and algorithms to produce mold details to mediate between the unique components and the repeated rig forms. The last design experiment is the most elaborate, demonstrating a pavillion structure which incorporates all areas of development. The successful execution of this design experiment allows us to conclude that the building system in its current state of development is ready to be tested in a scale larger than the typical research pavilion.},

Unfortunately, linear blending schemes for skeletons or cages are not always easy to use because they may require manual weight painting or modeling closed polyhedral envelopes around objects. Our goal is to make the design and control of deformations simpler by allowing the user to work freely with the most convenient combination of handle types. We develop linear blending weights that produce smooth and intuitive deformations for points, bones and cages of arbitrary topology. Our weights, called bounded biharmonic weights, minimize the Laplacian energy subject to bound constraints. Doing so spreads the influences of the controls in a shape-aware and localized manner, even for objects with complex and concave boundaries. The variational weight optimization also makes it possible to customize the weights so that they preserve the shape of specified essential object features. We demonstrate successful use of our blending weights for real-time deformation of 2D and 3D shapes.},

  abstract = {Concrete is the most used human-made material in the world, and it is responsible for around 8\% of the total greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. Hence, efficient concrete construction methods are one of the main foci of research in architecture, civil engineering, and material science. One recent development that promises to achieve this goal is the use of digital fabrication for building components. Most investigations focus on direct extrusion 3D printing with concrete, which has already been covered in several review articles. Conversely, this article reviews a different approach, which focuses on the indirect digital fabrication of concrete through 3D printed formworks. This approach is under investigation for structural and nonstructural, as well as for on- and off-site applications, with a number of projects having already been built, but a comprehensive review of 3D printed formworks has not yet been compiled to synthesize the findings. This article provides a comprehensive map of the state-of-the-art of five different 3D printing technologies used for the fabrication of formworks so far. The aim is to serve as a fundamental reference for future research, provide a basis for consistent language in this field, and support the development of construction standards. The article further discusses the new geometric possibilities with 3D printed formworks and their potential for making concrete construction more sustainable. In addition, the opportunities and challenges of 3D printed formworks are evaluated in the context of other traditional and digital fabrication tools. A synthetic classification in five functional typologies is proposed and illustrated with 30 representative case studies. Finally, the article concludes with a brief reflection on the role of 3D printing in the broader context of formwork innovation and a possible outlook for this technology.},

The   implications of Submillimetre Formwork are a considerable material reduction, faster off-site fabrication time for the formwork, ease of transportation to site, ease of on-site assembly and unprecedented design opportunities for free form and highly detailed concrete components.},

  abstract = {On-site robotic construction not only has the potential to enable architectural assemblies that exceed the size and complexity practical with laboratory-based prefabrication methods, but also offers the opportunity to leverage context-specific, locally sourced materials that are inexpensive, abundant, and low in embodied energy. We introduce a process for constructing dry stone walls in situ, facilitated by a customized autonomous hydraulic excavator. Cabin-mounted LiDAR sensors provide for terrain mapping, stone localization and digitization, and a planning algorithm determines the placement position of each stone. As the properties of the materials are unknown at the beginning of construction, and because error propagation can hinder the efficacy of pre-planned assemblies with non-uniform components, the structure is planned on-the-fly: the desired position of each stone is computed immediately before it is placed, and any settling or unexpected deviations are accounted for. We present the first result of this geometric- and motion-planning process: a 3-m-tall wall composed of 40 stones with an average weight of 760 kg.},

In this research we proposed an alternative approach based on implementation of expanded polystyrene (EPS), a non-standard material for shells, in the process of industrial robot fabrication that enables fast and precise cutting of building elements. Main motivation for using EPS as a building material was driven by numerous advantages when compared to commonly used materials such as: recycleability, cost-efficiency, high earthquake resistance, durability and short assembly time. We describe case specific fabrication approach based on numerous production constraints (size of the panels, limited robot workspace, in situ conditions) that directly design the process.},

  abstract = {The application of curved facade designs in contemporary architectural practice has become adamant in combining the digital tools with the material properties. By expanding the focus to manufacturing as well, the topic of waste is introduced. In order to avoid the generation of waste material during fabrication, in this research a workflow is introduced which describes the design of freeform surfaces out of expanded polystyrene blocks (EPS), while producing zero waste. The main premise is that a piece cut out of an EPS block has a piece that is left inside the block, its complement. Following the premise, it is only necessary to design one half of the freeform surface over a desired facade area and the other part would align to it. After the freeform surface is generated, a tessellation process is described, prepared for robotic hotwire cutting, following the limitation of the EPS block dimension and the inclusion of the minimal insulating layer.},

However, RBE is a purely force-based formulation, and it incorrectly describes stability when complex interface geometries are involved. To overcome this issue, this paper introduces the coupled rigid-block analysis (CRA) method, a more robust approach building upon RBE’s strengths. The CRA method combines equilibrium and kinematics in a penalty formulation in a nonlinear programming problem. An extensive benchmark campaign is used to show how CRA enables accurate modelling of complex three-dimensional discrete-element assemblies formed by rigid blocks. In addition, an interactive stability-aware design process to guide user design towards structurally-sound assemblies is proposed. Finally, the potential of our method for real-world problems are demonstrated by designing complex and scaffolding-free physical models.},

  abstract = {During the last decade, sampling-based path planning algorithms, such as Probabilistic RoadMaps (PRM) and Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT), have been shown to work well in practice and possess theoretical guarantees such as probabilistic completeness. However, little effort has been devoted to the formal analysis of the quality of the solution returned by such algorithms, e.g., as a function of the number of samples. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap, by rigorously analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the cost of the solution returned by stochastic sampling-based algorithms as the number of samples increases. A number of negative results are provided, characterizing existing algorithms, e.g., showing that, under mild technical conditions, the cost of the solution returned by broadly used sampling-based algorithms converges almost surely to a non-optimal value. The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of new algorithms, namely, PRM∗ and RRT∗, which are provably asymptotically optimal, i.e., such that the cost of the returned solution converges almost surely to the optimum. Moreover, it is shown that the computational complexity of the new algorithms is within a constant factor of that of their probabilistically complete (but not asymptotically optimal) counterparts. The analysis in this paper hinges on novel connections between stochastic sampling-based path planning algorithms and the theory of random geometric graphs.},

We report a whole-cell computational model of the life cycle of the human pathogen Mycoplasma genitalium that includes all of its molecular components and their interactions. An integrative approach to modeling that combines diverse mathematics enabled the simultaneous inclusion of fundamentally different cellular processes and experimental measurements. Our whole-cell model accounts for all annotated gene functions and was validated against a broad range of data. The model provides insights into many previously unobserved cellular behaviors, including in vivo rates of protein-DNA association and an inverse relationship between the durations of DNA replication initiation and replication. In addition, experimental analysis directed by model predictions identified previously undetected kinetic parameters and biological functions. We conclude that comprehensive whole-cell models can be used to facilitate biological discovery.},

  abstract = {Supporting various applications of digital fabrication and manufacturing, the industrial robot is typically assigned repetitive tasks for specific pre-programmed and singular applications. We propose a novel approach for robotic fabrication and manufacturing entitled Compound Fabrication, supporting multi-functional and multi-material processes. This approach combines the major manufacturing technologies including additive, formative and subtractive fabrication, as well as their parallel integration. A 6axis robotic arm, repurposed as an integrated 3D printing, milling and sculpting platform, enables shifting between fabrication modes and across scales using different end effectors. Promoting an integrated approach to robotic fabrication, novel combination processes are demonstrated including 3D printing and milling fabrication composites. In addition, novel robotic fabrication processes are developed and evaluated, such as multiaxis plastic 3D printing, direct recycling 3D printing, and embedded printing. The benefits and limitations of the Compound Fabrication approach and its experimental platform are reviewed and discussed. Finally, contemplation regarding the future of multi-functional robotic fabrication is offered, in the context of the experiments reviewed and demonstrated in this paper.},

Information technologies will progress, instead, by“meta-designing” mechanisms of system selfassembly, self-regulation and evolution. Nature offers a great variety of efficient complex systems, in which numerous small elements form large-scale, adaptive patterns. The new engineering challenge is to recreate this self-organization and let it freely generate innovative designs under guidance. This article presents an original model of artificial system growth inspired by embryogenesis. A virtual organism is a lattice of cells that proliferate, migrate and self-pattern into differentiated domains. Each cell’s fate is controlled by an internal gene regulatory network. Embryomorphic engineering emphasizes hyperdistributed architectures, and their development as a prerequisite of evolutionary design.},

Additive manufacturing (AM) technologies, especially three-dimensional concrete printing (3DCP) technology, have provided many benefits for construction. However, holistic comparative studies of the competitiveness of 3DCP and conventional methods, from cost and time perspectives, are lacking. Choosing between the methods is difficult for practitioners. In this study, we investigated the current state of 3DCP in the construction industry using seven distinct scenarios. Our analysis was performed to illustrate the impact of design and supply chain configurations on performance. The results prove the notable competitiveness of 3DCP. In contrast to the conventional construction method, the more complex round design had a positive impact on the cost and process time in 3DCP scenarios. Additionally, we show that on-site 3DCP using a robotic arm was more cost-effective than off-site 3DCP.},

  abstract = {The potential application of 3D printing technology is envisioned to create a third industrial revolution creating disruption in the economy, providing personalization and adaptation of the design. The construction field is quickly catching up with this new technology using the aid of a concrete 3D printer, the development of which is aimed at providing safer working conditions, economy and architectural freedom. The process of extrusion-based concrete printing requires the printable mix to flow through the distribution network and be deposited layer-by-layer on the build substrate or directly on-site analogous to the ink-jet printing process. In this case, for the mix to be printable, it should be capable of being pumped, extruded and deposited in layers within an optimized duration of time. The printing time-gap between layers is complicated by the scale and complexity of the geometry. The rheological behavior of the fresh mix will have a significant influence on the ability of the mix to be pumped and extruded while the mechanical response of the fresh concrete will influence the ability of the concrete printer to build layers with bonded interfaces. The design mixes are formulated to provide the maximum compressive and tensile strengths to the printed specimen which are influenced by the print parameters like time gap between layers, size of the nozzle in relation to the aggregate size. This paper aims at reviewing the concrete-mixes including fiber-reinforced, Geopolymer mixes suitable for the 3D printing process looking at both the fresh and hardened properties of the mix while simultaneously shedding light on appropriate printing parameters. The strategies used by researchers, in selecting appropriate material mix to tune the fresh properties of concrete and to improve the interfacial bond strength are discussed. Recommendations are provided to improve the quality of 3D printing process.},

  abstract = {The built environment defines humankind’s daily lives, sophistication, efficiency, and effectiveness. Despite this, its primary industry, constructiondwhich transforms the built environment into a reality and an operationdremains in need of more efficient, innovative, and sustainable strategies, technologies, and instruments. The incorporation of digital fabrication into 3D printing (3DP) technology offers an entirely different and expanded freedom of geometry, functionality, materials, savings, efficiency, and effectiveness. For the inherent potential of 3DP technology, its sustainability assessment and potential contributions should be explored systematically to shed light on future applications and further innovations. This study presents a systematic review of the sustainability potential, assessments, and challenges of 3DP concrete for built environment applications. A comprehensive and comparative review of related literature is performed to identify the current trends and research gaps and recommend reducing or eliminating the energy and environmental footprints and the socio-economic impact. The study concludes that, in terms of documented global warming potential (GWP) values, 3DP technology appears to be a promising alternative to conventional construction and concrete use. A life cycle analysis (LCA) is recorded that is meant to be widely used as an assessment tool for environmental and energy assessment in digital fabrication technology, leaving an integrated review, including social and economic aspects, understudied. The 3DP concrete technology has unlimited potential in terms of material flexibility, savings, labour’s cost, design flexibility, and operation agility. Besides, researchers intend on introducing unconventional and locally available materials to increase the sustainability of 3DP technology in construction.},

  abstract = {Today digital models for design exploration are not used to their full potential. The research efforts in the past decades have placed geometric design representations firmly at the center of digital design environments. In this thesis it is argued that models for design exploration that bridge different representation aid in the discovery of novel designs. Replacing commonly used analytical, uni-directional models for linking representations, with bidirectional ones, further supports design exploration. The key benefit of bidirectional models is the ability to swap the role of driver and driven in the exploration. The thesis developed around a set of design experiments that tested the integration of bidirectional computational models in domain specific designs. From the experiments three main exploration types emerged. They are: branching explorations for establishing constraints for an undefined design problem; illustrated in the design of a concept car. Circular explorations for the refinement of constraint relationships; illustrated in the design of a chair. Parallel explorations for exercising well-understood constraints; illustrated in a form finding model in architecture. A key contribution of the thesis is the novel use of constraint diagrams developed to construct design explorers for the experiments. The diagrams show the importance of translations between design representations in establishing design drivers from the set of constraints. The incomplete mapping of design features across different representations requires the redescription of the design for each translation.},

Until recently, standards for CAD data exchange among different CAD systems were restricted to the exchange of pure shape information. These standards ignored the parameters, constraints, features, and other elements of ‘design intent’ present in the model to be transferred. This paper suggests an implementational foundation for CAD data exchange with parametric information for the preservation of design intent, based on the use of newly published parts of the International Standard ISO 10303, which is informally known as STEP – STandard for Exchange of Product model data. A case study is presented, which employs a hypothetical STEP application protocol (AP) using Parts 55, 108 and 111 of ISO 10303. A prototype translator based on this AP has been implemented and tested. The paper reports on the experience gained in parametric data exchange.},

When constructing an autonomous rammed-earth construction method, an alternative means of assuring the performance at the initial age of the binder in terms of materials is needed. In this study, in order to satisfy the performance of the red clay binder, epoxy emulsion was added to analyze the compressive strength, water loosening, shrinkage, rate of mass change, and microstructure in the range of the initial age.

Design/methodology/approach – The method utilizes the dynamic model of the robot manipulators to find the maximum kinematic constraints that are used with conventional trajectory patterns, such as trapezoidal velocity profiles and cubic polynomial functions. Findings – The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can decrease the motion times substantially compared with the conventional kinematic method. Practical implications – Although the method used a dynamic model, the computational burden is minimized by calculating dynamics only at certain points, enabling implementation of the method online. The proposed method is tested on more than 40 different types of robots made by Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. Ltd (HHI). The method is successfully implemented in Hi5, a new generation of HHI robot controller.},

We show that implicit configuration spaces defined by constraints can be presented to sampling-based planners by addressing two key fundamental primitives: sampling and local planning, and that imacs preserves theoretical properties of probabilistic completeness and asymptotic optimality through these primitives. Within imacs, we implement projection- and continutation-based methods for constraint adherence, and demonstrate the framework on a range of planners with both methods in simulated and realistic scenarios. Our results show that the choice of method for constraint adherence depends on many factors and that novel combinations of planners and methods of constraint adherence can be more effective than previous approaches. Our implementation of imacs is open source within the Open Motion Planning Library and is easily extended for novel planners and constraint spaces.},

This paper presents the basic principles of the SC3DP technology together with the results of a comparative study on the influence of the two concrete printing techniques extrusion and SC3DP on the interlayer bond strength. In particular, the effect of different time intervals between the deposition of two adjacent layers regarding mechanical properties (bond strength) is investigated. As will be shown, the SC3DP method allows convenient mechanical properties although the printed samples exhibit distinct anisotropies. The reasons are discussed based on investigations of the air void distribution by micro CT and mechanical test results.},

Nowadays, reinforced concrete is the most widely used material in construction. The use of system formwork and easy‐to‐install reinforcement support structures that are optimised in terms of labour costs, but often have inefficient use of material. In this context, Stefan Polónyi has repeatedly criticised the engineers’ lost understanding of the interaction of concrete and reinforcement. With Additive Manufacturing, an innovative digital manufacturing technology is now available that allows new freedom in concrete design with a resource‐efficient use of materials at the same time. With regard to practical application, the integration of reinforcement represents a central challenge in 3D‐concrete‐printing. The authors see here the future chance of a force‐flow controlled reinforcement layout. The paper shows new strategies for the combined Additive Manufacturing of concrete and reinforcement and presents first 3D‐printed reinforced concrete elements.},

Im Unterschied zu anderen Produktionsbereichen ist die Herstellung von Gebäuden durch individualisierte Bauprozesse gekennzeichnet.

A key motivation for studying such material is that one can approximate doubly-curved surfaces (such as the sphere) using only flat pieces, making it attractive for fabrication. We physically realize surfaces by introducing cuts into approximately inextensible material such as sheet metal, plastic, or leather. The cutting pattern is modeled as a regular triangular linkage that yields hexagonal openings of spatially-varying radius when stretched. In the same way that isometry is fundamental to modeling developable surfaces, we leverage conformal geometry to understand auxetic design. In particular, we compute a global conformal map with bounded scale factor to initialize an otherwise intractable non-linear optimization. We demonstrate that this global approach can handle non-trivial topology and non-local dependencies inherent in auxetic material. Design studies and physical prototypes are used to illustrate a wide range of possible applications.},

The first part of investigation refers to the form-finding of the overall shell structure, as well as its structural members by using topology optimization principles. The second part deals with the development of a reconfigurable modular formwork, which adapts to all shape alternations of the structural components, enabling their effective fabrication by using a single mechanism. Within this framework, decisions taken in the optimization stage are evaluated based on limitations and potentials of the suggested formwork, whose reconfigurability influences fabrication outcomes and vice versa.},

  abstract = {The rural, remote, and wild territories we call "countryside", or the 98\% of the earth's surface not occupied by cities, make up the front line where today's most powerful forces--climate and ecological devastation, migration, tech, demographic lurches--are playing out. Increasingly under a 'Cartesian' regime--gridded, mechanized, and optimized for maximal production--these sites are changing beyond recognition. In his latest publication, Rem Koolhaas explores the rapid and often hidden transformations underway across the Earth's vast non-urban areas. Countryside, A Report gathers travelogue essays exploring territories marked by global forces and experimentation at the edge of our consciousness: a test site near Fukushima, where the robots that will maintain Japan's infrastructure and agriculture are tested; a greenhouse city in the Netherlands that may be the origin for the cosmology of today's countryside; the rapidly thawing permafrost of Central Siberia, a region wrestling with the possibility of relocation; refugees populating dying villages in the German countryside and intersecting with climate change activists; habituated mountain gorillas confronting humans on 'their' territory in Uganda; the American Midwest, where industrial-scale farming operations are coming to grips with regenerative agriculture; and Chinese villages transformed into all-in-one factory, e-commerce stores, and fulfillment centers. This book is the official companion to the Guggenheim Museum exhibition Countryside, The Future. The exhibition and book mark a new area of investigation for architect and urbanist Rem Koolhaas, who launched his career with two city-centric entities: The Office for Metropolitan Architecture (1975) and Delirious New York (1978). It's designed by Irma Boom, who drew inspiration for the book's pocket-sized concept, as well as its innovative typography and layout, from her research in the Vatican library.

  abstract = {This paper is about an experimental study on the mechanical behavior of rammed earth under compression and indirect tensile stresses. Local raw earth and sand are the base materials used. As stabilizers, cement, lime, barley straw and date palm fibers were used to manufacture the specimens tested. In all, five different mixtures were prepared and tested. The cylindrical specimens used were prepared under optimum compaction references using the Proctor test procedures. Two types of mechanical tests were performed: the uniaxial compression test and the splitting tensile strength test. For each compression test, four parameters were determined: the compressive strength, the initial tangent modulus, the secant modulus at maximum stress and the peak axial strain corresponding to the maximum compressive stress. The results obtained show that, plant fibers (barley straw or date palm fibers) can provide improvements in rammed earth strengths such as those that cement or lime can provide, especially in tensile strength. The results also show that plant fibers decrease the stiffness of rammed earth while cement and lime increase it. Nevertheless, a coefficient of proportionality of about 0.6 was observed between the secant modulus and the initial tangent modulus for all the mixtures tested. In addition, a linear correlation between tensile strength and compressive strength has been established in the cases of both unstabilized and cement-or-lime-stabilized rammed earth. However, no similar correlation has been found when considering fiber-reinforced rammed earth, because the adhesion of the fibers used to the sand-earth matrix has more effect on tensile strength than on compressive strength.},

  abstract = {In biology, the importance of environmental feedback to the process of embryogenesis is well understood. In this paper we explore the introduction of a local fitness to an artificial developmental system, providing an artificial analogue to the natural phenomenon. First, we define a highly simplified model of vasculogenesis, an environment-based toy problem in which we can evaluate our strategies. Since the use of a global fitness function for local feedback is likely too computationally expensive, we introduce the notion of a neighbourhoodbased “local fitness” function. This local fitness serves as an environmental-feedback guide for the developmental system. The result is a developmental analogue of guided hill-climbing, one which significantly improves the performance of an artificial embryogeny in the evolution of a simplified vascular system. We further evaluate our model in a collection of randomly generated two-dimensional geometries, and show that inclusion of local fitness helps allay some of the problem difficulty in irregular environments. In the process, we also introduce a novel and systematic means of generating bounded, connected two-dimensional geometries.},

To handle the considerable amounts of data generated in the process of scanning building structures, we present intelligent compression approaches combined with the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) as an efficient serialization and an alternative to clear text encoded ISO 10303 part 21 files.

  abstract = {Massive walls exposed to the natural climate without special rain protection show a dynamic moisture equilibrium governed by the alternating events of rain and sunshine. The moisture further reduces the rather low insulation level of the walls. Therefore, thermal insulation measures have to be taken in order to improve the hygienic conditions and the thermal performance of the building. The influence of interior and exterior insulations on the hygrothermal behaviour of such walls can be determined with the aid of a recently developed computer program which has been experimentally validated by comparison with field tests. The results show that an exterior insulation leads to the drying of the wall, with the drying rate depending on the vapour permeability of the insulation system. An interior insulation, however, results in a rising water content of the wall due to the decreasing masonry temperature. This effect is almost independent of the vapour permeability of the insulating material. While an exterior insulation also improves the thermal resistance of the masonry, an interior insulation has the opposite effect and increases the frost damage risk. Therefore, the interior insulation of exposed walls should be combined with rain protection measures at the facade.}

The conventional ways of design development largely depends on excessive material usage, very high design margins – hence, in turn ending up consuming more material into the structures, buildings. Since last couple of decades, computational power is becoming more efficient and affordable to everyone. This availability of high capacity computational power gave of designer the opportunity for evaluating multiple options during the development phase itself, using finite element analysis methods. Also, the efforts of the researchers helped our field with many innovative and matured algorithms for optimizing the multiple design variables considering given constraints, scenarios at the same time. The combination of high power computation with these algorithms is giving the designers limitless opportunities for managing the development more effectively and efficiently. This paper discusses various optimization techniques and apply them to real world cases like reinforced concrete structures in virtual environment. The study includes survey of structural optimization principles, procedures, software tools available for structural design \& analysis. Further, it discusses about the optimization of multi-storey reinforced concrete structures (RCC) building structure using structural analysis software like STAAD-PRO along with modern optimization tools like MINITAB and Evolutionary Algorithm.},

  abstract = {Earthen construction is regaining popularity as an ecological and economical alternative to contemporary building materials. While building with earth offers several benefits, its performance due to water ingress is a concern for its widespread application. This limitation is often solved by adding chemical stabilisers such as Portland cement and hydraulic lime. Chemical stabilisers are a subject of widespread debate as they increase the cost and embodied energy of the structure, and reduce the desirable characteristics of raw or unstabilised earth. This along with perceived environmental performance, renewability, and proven effectiveness in traditional earthen construction has led to a growing interest in biological or organic stabilisers. Although the strengthening mechanism of biological stabilisers is widely covered in scientific studies, discussion regarding the water-resistance is limited. This review aggregates the research from the field of earthen construction and geotechnical engineering and extends it to explain the possible mechanism responsible for the water-resistance behaviour of biologically stabilised earthen materials. This study includes a wide range of traditional and industrial biological stabilisers derived from animals (cow-dung, casein, chitosan), plants (starch, guar gum, cactus mucilage, lignin, tannin) seaweeds (alginate, agar, carrageen) and microbes (xanthan gum, gellan gum). A conceptual model of water-ingress in unstabilised earthen blocks is proposed and the response of biological stabiliser to water ingress and related physico-chemical and physical factors is discussed using the model at microscale (stabiliser interaction with clay, sand) and macroscale (hydraulic conductivity of block). Properties of stabilisers such as hydrophobicity, stability under wet conditions or interaction with cations have a dominant effect on the overall response to water ingress. Key gaps have been identified in the existing knowledge that are necessary to investigate in order to understand the water-resistance behaviour comprehensively. The study concludes with a brief assessment of biological stabilisers based on their performance and feasibility to use in contemporary earthen construction.},

However, the low image of earthen materials is a major barrier to its acceptance in India, and is caused due to its poor water resistance performance. This research focuses on developing a low-cost, water resistant and desirable earthen building material for rural housing in India. This thesis contributes toward a better understanding of water ingress and water resistance in unstabilised and biologically stabilised earthen materials, especially cow-dung stabilised earthen blocks. Moreover, it addresses the three key aspects identified for rural earthen housing in India; 1. Affordability, by using inexpensive techniques and binder; 2. Durability, by enhancing the water resistance in both unstabilised and cow-dung stabilised earthen material, and 3. Desirability, by producing Compressed Earth Blocks of a good finish and aesthetic and using a widely acceptable stabiliser. The research work is expected not only to provide scientific insights that facilitate understanding and adoption of earthen materials but also the knowledge that can be directly applied in the construction of earthen houses.},

  abstract = {The water-resistance of cow-dung has made it a widely used stabiliser in traditional earthen structures in several Asian and African countries. Multiple studies have shown an improvement in water-resistance with the addition of cow-dung, but none provides insight into this behaviour. The present study investigates the water-resistance behaviour of cow-dung stabilised earthen blocks through an extensive experimental programme to identify and characterise the components of cowdung responsible for its water-resistance. Fresh cow-dung was collected and separated into fibres ({$>$}63 µm), medium-sized microbial aggregates (1-63 µm) and small-sized microbial aggregates (0.57 µm). Each component was mixed with soil and samples were prepared at different water contents (optimum water content corresponding to the highest dry density and water content higher than optimum) and compacted with 2.5 MPa force to prepare compressed blocks. The water-resistance of these blocks was evaluated through the immersion and modified drip/rain test. It was found that the small-sized microbial aggregates are almost entirely responsible for water-resistance behaviour of cow-dung stabilised earthen blocks. Small-sized microbial aggregates were further characterised by gas chromatography, mercury intrusion porosimetry, N2- BET surface area, zeta potential measurement and electron microscopy. The results indicate that the small-sized microbial aggregates are composed of clay-sized negatively charged particles that are rich in fatty acids. The hydrophobicity of these particles is hypothesised to be responsible for water-resistance behaviour. These insights are further used to produce stabilised blocks that performed at least 30 times better than the unstabilised blocks in both water-resistance tests. The study concludes with practical recommendations for the use of wet cow-dung over dry cow-dung and a reduction of fibre content to increase the water-resistance of earthen blocks.},

We first propose, in the case of extrusion-based additive manufacturing, a simple functional unit that relates a volume-based material impact and a time-based process impact through the printing head velocity and the filament cross section. We then compute, for two robotic arms/bi-component case studies, the embodied impact related to the production of the printing cells themselves and measure their hourly electrical power consumptions. Our results and analysis suggest that the relative contribution to climate change of the printing process alone depends mostly on its spatial resolution. This suggests finally the existence of an optimal printing resolution that may allow for the highest material saving while minimizing the process-related climate change impact.},

Computational limitations that relate to the capacity of computer machines as well as analysis restrictions that relate to the allowable grid node count imposed by daylight simulation software prohibit daylight-coefficient based calculations on large scale analysis grids. The present paper utilizes a real aviation project and presents the development of a workflow that provides the ability to perform very demanding processes in acceptable time. Radiance related ray-tracing processes and matrix multiplications occur on the cloud using High Performance Computing and custom scripts that facilitate and accelerate the progression. The analysis grid count is decomposed into manageable fragments and after the calculation is performed, the fragmented values are recomposed in one single list of results that are utilized for colouring the analysis grid mesh. Processes are sped up by approximately 32 times. Customized tools can be adaptive and reused in other applications with minimum modifications. The methodology can also be adopted for performing other annual climate-based simulations or for glare studies.},

Based on techniques from graphic statics, the force distribution in building structures is visualized using geometric diagrams. This diagrammatic representation allows a formal description that shows the relationship between the force flow and the structural form. The formal character of this description enables the direct implementation of a parametric truss geometry that maintains major structural behavioral characteristics under deformation. An interactive model of a structural freeform roof is developed through this link between a parametric truss definition and a design-driving NURBS surface. This allows for an intuitive exploration of the constrained design space in real time. Formal explorations and the comparison with built examples demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.},

  abstract = {In the construction industry, as well as during the assembly of large-scale components, the required workspaces usually cannot be served by a stationary robot. Instead, mobile robots are used to increase the accessible space. Here, the problem arises that the accuracy of such systems is not sufficient to meet the tolerance requirements of the components to be produced. Furthermore, there is an additional difficulty in the trajectory planning process since the exact dimensions of the pre-manufactured parts are unknown. Hence, existing static planning methods cannot be exerted on every application. Recent approaches present dynamic planning algorithms based on specific component characteristics. For example, the latest methods follow the contour by a force-controlled motion or detect features with a camera. However, in several applications such as welding or additive manufacturing in construction, no contact force is generated that could be controlled. Vision-based approaches are generally restricted by varying materials and lighting conditions, often found in large-scale construction. For these reasons, we propose a more robust approach without measuring contact forces, which, for example, applies to large-scale additive manufacturing. We based our algorithm on a high-precision 2D line laser, capable of detecting different feature contours regardless of material or lightning. The laser is mounted to the robot’s end-effector and provides a depth profile of the component’s surface. From this depth data, we determine the target contour and control the manipulator to follow it. Simultaneously we vary the robot’s speed to adjust the feed rate depending on the contour’s shape, maintaining a constant material application rate. As a proof of concept, we apply the algorithm to the additive manufacturing of two-layer linear structures made from spray PU foam. When making these structures, each layer must be positioned precisely on the previous layer to obtain a straight wall and prevent elastic buckling or plastic collapse. Initial experiments show improved layer alignment within 10 \% of the layer width, as well as better layer height consistency and process reliability.},

The printing process is based on a layer-wise material application, conducted along a pre-designed printing path. However, material batch in-homogeneities and environmental alteration lead to varying concrete properties over the production processes. These material irregularities stochastically affect the layer geometry and thus limit the achievable reproducibility and accuracy. To enhance the process stability and improve the dimensional component quality in case of environmental changes, a reliable mapping between the strand geometry and the process and material parameters is fundamental for systematic cross-section adjustment. In this paper, we present an experimental-based approach for attaining a flexible regression model of the cross-section of Shotcrete 3D Printed concrete strands. The width and height of the layer are chosen for the strand representation, which we considered as the main factors for the printing-path planning. Regarding the modelling parameters, we focus on the volume flow parameters of concrete and air, and on the accelerator dosage. These inertia afflicted parameters can provide a consistent strand geometry, while factors of lower latency such as printing speed or spray distance are conserved for online adaptation. Based on the presented proceeding, an adjustable layer height and width model has been successfully used to predict the strand properties. The production of a medium sized sample wall further proves the applicability to the production process. In addition, we demonstrated that the chosen parameters not only affect the geometry but also the mechanical performance of SC3DP-specimens. This is evaluated based on flexural strength measurements. Given the geometrical and mechanical properties, the study defines applicable limits for the investigated parameters.},

In the 1990s, languages of continuity, smoothness and seamlessness dominated the architectural inquiry with the CNC milling machine as its manufacturing tool. Today’s computational design and fabrication technology look at languages of synthesis of fragments or particles, with the 3D printer as its fabrication archetype. Fundamental to this idea is the concept of resolution–the amount of information stored at any localized region. Construction of a shape is then based on multiple regions of resolution. This paper explores a novel design methodology that takes this concept of resolutions on discrete elements as a design driver for architectural practice. This research has been tested primarily through additive manufacturing techniques.},

We propose a simple design that offers a chance: individuals pay for as many votes as they wish using a number of "voice credits" in the votes they buy. Only quadratic cost induces marginal costs linear in votes purchased and thus welfare optimality if individuals' valuation of votes is proportional to their value of changing the outcome. A variety of analysis and evidence suggests that this still-nascent mechanism has significant promise to robustly correct the failure of existing democracies to incorporate intensity of preference and knowledge.},

  abstract = {In the ceramic industry and in many sectors, clay minerals are widely used. In earthen construction technique, clay plays a crucial role in the processing. The purpose of this research is to understand and modify the clay properties in earth material to propose an innovative strategy to develop a castable earth-based material. To do so, we focused on the modification of clay properties at fresh state with inorganic additives. As the rheological behaviour of clays is controlled by their surface charge, the addition of phosphate anion allows discussing deep the rheology of concentrated clay suspensions. We highlighted the thixotropic and shear thickening behaviour of a dispersed kaolinite clay suspensions. Indeed, by adding sodium hexametaphosphate the workability of clay paste increases and the behaviour is stable during time after a certain shear is applied. Moreover, we stress that the aging and the shift in critical strain in clay system are due to the re-arrangement of clay suspension and a decrease of deformation during time. The understanding of both effect: thixotropy and aging are crucial for better processing of clay-based material and for self-compacting clay concrete. Yet, studies need to pursue to better understand the mechanism.},

New entrepreneurial, innovative start-ups are popping up everywhere challenging the traditional model of the architect. However, it also poses new questions and challenges in the education of the architect today. What are the appropriate pedagogical methods to instill enthusiasm for new technologies, materials, and craft? How do we avoid the pure application of pre-set tools, such as the use of the laser cutter has become, which in many schools around the world has caused problems rather than solving problems? How do we teach students to invent their tools especially in a society that doesn't have a strong background in the making? The primary focus of this paper is on how architectural CAAD/ CAM education through the use of robotic fabrication can enhance student's understanding, passion and knowledge of materiality, technology, and craftsmanship. The paper is based on the pedagogical set-up and method of an M. Arch I studio that was taught by the author in fall 2016 with the focus on robotic fabrication, materiality, traditional timber construction systems, tool design and digital and physical craftsmanship.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the feasibility of in-situ manufacturing of a functionally graded metallic regolith. To fabricate the gradient, digital light processing, an additive manufacturing technique, and spark plasma sintering were selected due to their compatibility with metallic-ceramic processing in a space environment. The chosen methods were first assessed for their ability to effectively consolidate regolith alone, before progressing to sintering regolith directly onto metallic substrates. Optimized processing conditions based on the sintering temperature, initial powder particle size, and different compositions of the lunar regolith powders were identified. Experiments have successfully proven the consolidation of lunar regolith simulants at 1050°C under 80 MPa with digital light processing and spark plasma sintering, while the metallic powders can be fully densified at relatively low temperatures and a pressure of 50 MPa with spark plasma sintering. Furthermore, the lunar regolith and Ti6Al4V gradient were proven to be the most promising combination. While the current study showed that it is feasible to manufacture a functionally graded metallic regolith, further developments of a fully optimized method have the potential to produce tailored, high-performance materials in an off-earth manufacturing setting for the production of aerospace, robotic, or architectural components.},

The concept of Concurrent Engineering (CE) – interdisciplinary, but with an engineering focus – was developed to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the Product Creation Process (PCP) by conducting different phases of a product’s life concurrently. Transdisciplinary Engineering has transcended CE, emphasizing the crucial importance of interdisciplinary openness and collaboration. This book presents the proceedings of the 28th ISTE International Conference on Transdisciplinary Engineering (TE2021). Held online from 5 – 9 July 2021 and entitled ‘Transdisciplinary Engineering for Resilience: Responding to System Disruptions’, this is the second conference in the series held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The annual TE conference constitutes an important forum for international scientific exchange on transdisciplinary engineering research, advances, and applications, and is attended by researchers, industry experts and students, as well as government representatives. The book contains 58 peer-reviewed papers, selected from more than 80 submissions and ranging from the theoretical and conceptual to strongly pragmatic and addressing industrial best practice. The papers are grouped under 6 headings covering theory; education and training; PD methods and digital TE; industry and society; product systems; and individuals and teams. Providing an overview of the latest research results and knowledge of product creation processes and related methodologies, the book will be of interest to all researchers, design practitioners, and educators working in the field of Transdisciplinary Engineering.},

Here we show that the generating principles of developable surfaces were also at the core of their study by Monge. In a historical context, from the beginning of the study of developable surfaces, to the contributions Monge made to the field, it can be seen that the nature of developable surfaces is closely related to the spatial intuition and treatment of space as defined by Monge through his descriptive geometry, which played a major role in developing an international language of geometrical communication for architecture and engineering. The use of developable surfaces in the architecture of Frank Gehry is mentioned, in particular in relation to his fascination with ‘movement’ and its role in architectural design.},

  abstract = {In spite of the discrete nature of digital computers, the architectural ideology in the milieus invested in advanced technologies at the turn of the 21st century is based upon the concept of the ‘continuous’ in various aspects. The ideal of continuity between design and manufacturing, also known as ‘file-to-factory’, meaning an uninterrupted process from the computer-aided design of the project to its production by automated machines, further attaches this concept to the ‘making’. The flexible, precise computer numerically controlled machine plays then a key role, fulfilling the promise of diversified mass production, opposed to that of post-war industrialisation. However, standardisation has multiple faces; can intensive mechanisation be separate from it? Following Pierre Veltz talking about a hyper-industrial society rather than a post-industrial one, we question whether computer-aided construction is not likely evolving towards ‘hyper-standard’ rather than ‘nonstandard’ production.},

We aim to transition from highly individualized and complex formworks tailored for individual structures to simple formworks that can be reused and reconfigured to realize a variety of designs. Voxelcrete is a robotically tended formwork system in which modular formwork units are iteratively arranged for continuous casts of concrete. The system allows for the production of large scale concrete objects using reconfigurable, adaptive formwork.

There is vast potential to create a rich variety of new architectural forms by introducing curved rulings into ruled surfaces. This paper presents a new method to generate ruled surface variants by making a fundamental change to existing ruled surfaces through parametric reformulation and the use of curved rulings. A new type of ruled surface composed of curved rulings, the elastica-ruled surface, is proposed. An analytical geometric modelling method is developed based on the transformation of line-ruled surfaces, enabling convenient generation of elegant shapes and forms for architectural applications. In this paper, curved rulings are represented by elastica curves-large, elastic, bending deformations of a straight slender beam. We demonstrate that elastica curve design parameters can completely control the shape of an elastica-ruled surface and define a large set of transformation results. This study classifies elastica-ruled surfaces into five categories based on their shape characteristics. Potential applications of elastica-ruled surfaces that consider elastic bending behaviour are presented, including bending-active structures, robot-assisted manufacturing and kinetic architectural designs. By extension, this study shows that adopting higher-order elastica curves can further enhance the design diversity of novel architectural forms.},

  abstract = {Evolution provides a creative fount of complex and subtle adaptations that often surprise the scientists who discover them. However, the creativity of evolution is not limited to the natural world: artificial organisms evolving in computational environments have also elicited surprise and wonder from the researchers studying them. The process of evolution is an algorithmic process that transcends the substrate in which it occurs. Indeed, many researchers in the field of digital evolution can provide examples of how their evolving algorithms and organisms have creatively subverted their expectations or intentions, exposed unrecognized bugs in their code, produced unexpectedly adaptations, or engaged in behaviors and outcomes uncannily convergent with ones found in nature. Such stories routinely reveal surprise and creativity by evolution in these digital worlds, but they rarely fit into the standard scientific narrative. Instead they are often treated as mere obstacles to be overcome, rather than results that warrant study in their own right. Bugs are fixed, experiments are refocused, and one-off surprises are collapsed into a single data point. The stories themselves are traded among researchers through oral tradition, but that mode of information transmission is inefficient and prone to error and outright loss. Moreover, the fact that these stories tend to be shared only among practitioners means that many natural scientists do not realize how interesting and lifelike digital organisms are and how natural their evolution can be. To our knowledge, no collection of such anecdotes has been published before. This paper is the crowd-sourced product of researchers in the fields of artificial life and evolutionary computation who have provided first-hand accounts of such cases. It thus serves as a written, fact-checked collection of scientifically important and even entertaining stories. In doing so we also present here substantial evidence that the existence and importance of evolutionary surprises extends beyond the natural world, and may indeed be a universal property of all complex evolving systems.},

  abstract = {Industrial robots offer a good basis for machining from a conceptual point of view. However they are rarely utilized for machining applications in industry due to their low stiffness and the bad achievable work piece quality. Available solutions using position control of the tool require costly additional hardware and measurement equipment; force controlled solutions depend on low level controller access that is not commonly available for generic cell setups. This paper proposes a three-step approach to compensate for process force induced accuracy errors: (1) selection of appropriate milling strategies and cutting parameters, (2) an offline compensation of the force induced deviations and (3) a respective online compensation method. Experimental validation of the results has been performed for the first two steps.},

Having reached the scale of human activities, we consider the perception and generation of artistic creations, the study of motion and the generation of animated virtual objects, and the representation of geometrically complex systems in machining, metal forging, object design. We then move inside the human body itself with applications in medical imaging and biology, followed by the representation of molecular structures.

As the algorithms become more sophisticated, we no longer only need to di erentiate simple mathematical functions, but have to deal with general programs which encode complex transformations of data. is dissertation introduces three tools, for addressing the challenges that arise when obtaining and applying the derivatives for complex graphics algorithms. Traditionally, practitioners have been constrained to composing programs with a limited set of coarse-grained operators, or hand-deriving derivatives. We extend the image processing language Halide with reverse-mode automatic di erentiation, and the ability to automatically optimize the gradient computations. is enables automatic generation of the gradients of arbitrary Halide programs, at high performance, with little programmer e ort. We demonstrate several applications, including how our system enables quality improvements of even traditional, feed-forward image processing algorithms, blurring the distinction between classical and deep learning methods.},

Hence, we selected the Robotic-based Digital Fabrication Method that was being tested at that time. Considering the construction cost and period, we selected expandable polystyrene (EPS) as the material of the ceiling structure, and we developed and utilized BAT (a Grasshopper plug-in), to process the work as a free-form production method. We also invented a new cutting method to implement the specific types of components that were otherwise unlikely to be implemented due to the limitation of the straight hot-wire. This paper describes a transport system for the components of the framework, and a robotics-based on-site installation method that is required for the utilization of a robot in the fabrication of these structures.},

The cell wall hydraulic conductivity (permeability) is built in as well through the SPH equations. In the preliminary results presented in this paper, the model is subjected to benchmarks such as the retrieving of the Young-Laplace relation and the cell fluid pressure convergence during compression of a single cell.

The AM technology, called Shotcrete 3D Printing (SC3DP), is based on an automated shotcreteing process and offers the ability to integrate structural reinforcement in both principal directions and enables printing of horizontal cantilevers onto vertical surfaces. Moreover, the SC3DP technique effectively addresses the problem of cold joints that is inherent to other 3D printing techniques. However, as controlling the process parameters of the SC3DP technique is significantly more complex than it is for conventional 3D concrete printing processes, several closed-loop online control routines were developed and integrated. The resulting gain of control for this adaptive fabrication process is demonstrated through a case study for the production of a complexes reinforced concrete component. Moreover, its conceptual implications are discussed and an outlook for future work is given.},

Compared to other 3D Concrete Printing techniques as for example Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), SC3DP displays several distinct advantages: Firstly, the high velocity of the concrete projection eliminates the issue of weak interlayer connection-the so called "cold joints"; secondly the concrete can be sprayed around conventional reinforcement; and thirdly, due to the good layer bonding, printing gradual transitions from the vertical to the horizontal plane become possible. The latter eradicates the limitations of 2.5D extrusions, which currently restrict 3D Printing with concrete. This poster presents the first experiments of ongoing research, investigating the possibility to gradually alter the printing plane, allowing a continuous transition from the vertical to the horizontal plane and hence make a new set of geometries accessible to 3D Printing with concrete.},

As additive manufacturing technologies such as 3D printing and rapid prototyping become increasingly capable, traditional barriers of resources and skill for manufacturing are all but vanishing. Three-dimensional printers are giving designers unprecedented control over the shape and composition of matter. High-end 3D printers today can combine multiple materials into arbitrary patterns at a resolution close to 10 mm, leading to the ability to create geometry with fidelity and complexity that rivals that of the natural world. The growing accessibility of personal manufacturing tools, such as 3D printers, is democratizing design and enabling new types of designers. The combination of new geometric representations, new design paradigms, and new interfaces leads to new challenges and opportunities in the CAD field as never before. Good design tools are often the hidden enabler of technological innovation; however, balancing the existing performance engine with a new paradigm shift is a difficult but not an impossible task.},

  abstract = {Recently, there has been an increasing interest on the sustainability advantage of 3D concrete printing (3DCP), where the original cement-based mixtures used for printing could be replaced or incorporated with environmental-friendly materials. The development in digital modeling and design tools also creates a new realm of form-finding architecture for 3DCP, which is based on topological optimization of volumetric mass and physical performance. This review provides a perspective of using different green cementitious materials, applications of structural optimization, and modularization methods for realizing sustainable construction with additive manufacturing. The fresh and hardened mechanical properties of various sustainable materials for extrusion-based 3D printing are presented, followed by discussions on different topology optimization techniques. The current state of global research and industrial applications in 3DCP, along with the development of sustainable construction materials, is also summarized. Finally, research and practical gaps identified in this review lead to several recommendations on material developments, digital design tool’s prospects for 3DCP to achieve the sustainability goal.},

To comprehensively evaluate the engineering performance of SFL stabilized soil, 3, 7, 10, 12 and 15\% mixtures were tested and the influence of climate factors (assessed subjecting the soil to different freeze-thaw cycles) was also considered. The experimental program investigated mechanical strength (unconfined compressive strength) and physicochemical properties, which included grain size distribution, Atterberg limits, variation of elemental and mineral composition, pH, cation exchange capacity, X-ray diffraction/fluorescence and thermal conductivity. In addition, micro-characterization through SEM and pore size distribution was also performed. A considerable improvement of the mechanical properties was observed, which increases with SFL content up to 12\%. This was based on changes in the physical and not chemical properties, hinting that the stabilization mechanism consists in physical binding unlike for traditional soil stabilizers. Moreover, it was found that SFL addition improved frost resistance. Based on these results, utilizing SFL as a soil stabilizer for application in earthworks shows great potential and would promote the bio-ethanol industry and engineering construction to be more sustainable and greener, particularly because it does not risk inducing soil pH contamination unlike traditional chemical agents.},

  abstract = {Over the course of the 20th century, architectural construction has gone through intense innovation in its material, engineering and design, radically transforming the way buildings were and are conceived. Technological and industrial advances enabled and challenged architects, engineers and constructors to build increasingly complex architectural structures from concrete. Computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) techniques have, more recently, rejuvenated and increased the possibilities of realising ever more complex geometries. Reinforced concrete is often chosen for such structures as almost any shape can be achieved when placed into a formwork. However, most complex forms generated with these digital design tools bear little relation to the default modes of production used in concrete construction today. A large gap has emerged between the possibilities offered by digital technology in architectural design and the reality of the building industry, where actually no efficient solutions exist for the production of complex concrete structures. This paper presents construction methods that unfold their full potential by linking digital design, additive fabrication and material properties and hence allow accommodating the construction of complex concrete structures. The emphasis is set on the on-going research project Smart Dynamic Casting (SDC) where advanced material design and robotic fabrication are interconnected in the design and fabrication process of complex concrete structures. The proposed fabrication process is belonging to an emerging architectural phenomena defined first as Digital Materiality by Gramazio \& Kohler (2008) or more recently as Material Ecologies by Neri Oxman [2].},

  abstract = {"What happens when we let robots play the game of life? The challenge of studying evolution is that the history of life is buried in the past--we can't witness the dramatic events that shaped the adaptations we see today. But biorobotics expert John Long has found an ingenious way to overcome this problem: he creates robots that look and behave like extinct animals, subjects them to evolutionary pressures, lets them compete for mates and resources, and mutates their 'genes'. In short, he lets robots play the game of life. In Darwin's Devices, Long tells the story of these evolving biorobots--how they came to be, and what they can teach us about the biology of living and extinct species. Evolving biorobots can replicate creatures that disappeared from the Earth long ago, showing us in real time what happens in the face of unexpected environmental challenges. Biomechanically correct models of backbones functioning as part of an autonomous robot, for example, can help us understand why the first vertebrates evolved them. But the most impressive feature of these robots, as Long shows, is their ability to illustrate the power of evolution to solve difficult technological challenges autonomously--without human input regarding what a workable solution might be. Even a simple robot can create complex behavior, often learning or evolving greater intelligence than humans could possibly program. This remarkable idea could forever alter the face of engineering, design, and even warfare. An amazing tour through the workings of a fertile mind, Darwin's Devices will make you rethink everything you thought you knew about evolution, robot intelligence, and life itself"--},

  abstract = {The importance of earthen construction materials lies in their widespread availability combined with a low embodied energy. Chemical stabilizers are commonly used to improve their durability and mechanical performance. The main drawbacks are the high environmental impact of their production, the loss of recyclability, and the possible reduction of raw earth’s hygrothermal properties. Historically stabilization was achieved by the use of different kinds of fibers, agricultural wastes, and biopolymers incorporated into the earthen matrix. The purpose of the present study is to review the state of the art of investigations on the influence of natural additives for raw earthen materials, to promote and facilitate future research in this field. More than 50 independent studies have been considered, including different types of raw earth constructions: plasters, adobe, compressed earth blocks and rammed earth. To enlarge the opportunity of investigating the use of biopolymers as stabilizers, some studies about soil stabilization have been included in the review. Results show that the use of recycled and waste material as a natural additive is promising direction for future research as it can provide a sustainable alternative to chemical stabilization.},

  abstract = {The present treatise is the outcome of a suggestion made to me some years ago by Mr R. R. Webb that I should assist him in the preparation of a work on Elasticity. He has unfortunately found himself unable to proceed with it, and I have therefore been obliged to take upon myself the whole of the work and the whole of the responsibility. I wish to acknowledge at the outset the debt that I owe to him as a teacher of the subject, as well as my obligation for many valuable suggestions chiefly with reference to the scope and plan of the work, and to express my regret that other engagements have prevented him from sharing more actively in its production. The division of the subject adopted is that originally made by Clebsch in his classical treatise, where a clear distinction is ill-awn between exact solutions for bodies all whose dimensions are finite and approximate solutions for bodies some of whose dimensions can be regarded as infinitesimal. The present volume contains the general mathematical theory of the elastic properties of the first class of bodies, and I propose to treat the second class in another volume. At Mr Webb's suggestion, the exposition of the theory is preceded by an historical sketch of its origin and development. Anything like an exhaustive history has been rendered unnecessary by the work of the late Dr Todhunter as edited by Prof Karl Pearson, but it is hoped that the brief account given will at once facilitate the comprehension of the theory and add to its interest. Readers of the historical work referred to will appreciate the difficulty of giving within a reasonable compass a complete account of all the valuable researches that have been made; and the aim of this book is rather to present a connected account of the theory in its present state, and an indication of the way in which that state has been attained, avoiding on the one hand merely analytical developments, and on the other purely technical details.},

  abstract = {The adoption of 3D concrete printing (3DCP) contributes to the increase of automation and efficiency in construction. Recently, spray-based 3D concrete printing (S-3DCP) has been proposed specifically for vertical and overhanging applications, such as facades and ceiling decorations. Nevertheless, it is still very premature due to limited research studies on how various printing parameters affect material distribution in S-3DCP. This study tackles the issue by focusing on the effect of printing parameters, i.e., pumping rate, air injection pressure, nozzle travel speed, and nozzle standoff distance. Firstly, an analytical model was constructed involving a two-stage deposition process, i.e., under-compaction and full-compaction stages. The transition from the first stage to the second one occurred when the predicted section mass reaches critical section mass. The widths and average thicknesses of the sprayed filament were calculated in both stages, and material distribution was described with trapezoid function. Afterwards, a series of single-layer spray experiments was conducted to analyze the effect of printing parameters on material distribution and determine the constants in the proposed analytical model. Finally, the analytical model was validated by multiple-layer spray experiments. The average relative errors in predicting widths and average thicknesses were 15.29\% and 9.92\%, respectively, which illustrate the effectiveness of the model. The proposed analytical model can help guide the selection of printing parameters for S-3DCP, i.e., choosing suitable printing parameters for desired filament width and thickness. Furthermore, it can be utilized in the feedback control of spray-based 3D printing systems for efficiency improvement. The S-3DCP enhanced by the model has the potential to revolutionize the construction of vertical and overhanging decorative structures, such as customization of profiles, defect repair, and quantitative deposition of functional coatings.},

  abstract = {In the past decade, 3D printing is getting into more and more industry areas including building and construction. However, most 3D cementitious material printing processes are limited in horizontal printing surface. Due to the nature of building and construction industry, 3D spray cementitious material printing process was developed to apply material in vertical or even overhang surfaces. Unlike traditional manually operated spray method in building and construction industry, 3D spray cementitious material printing process requires higher accuracy on material distribution. In this paper, the effects of four printing parameters (cementitious material flow rate, air flow rate, nozzle travel speed, nozzle standoff distance) on material distribution in 3D spray cementitious material printing process were investigated experimentally. An experimental model, which can be further used in the control of 3D spray cementitious material printing process, was then developed upon on the results.},

  abstract = {3D concrete printing technology greatly facilitates automation in construction which enhances efficiency, productivity and sustainability. This study develops a slag-based mixture as a cementless material for sustainable spray-based 3D printing. Effects of MgO and fly ash cenosphere (FAC) addition on setting, hydration and rheological properties of fresh mixtures are investigated to obtain the optimal mixture. Results show that inclusion of MgO effectively reduces initial setting time of the fresh mixtures. With 40 wt\% of GGBS replaced by MgO, initial setting time is greatly reduced from 305 min to 67 min (78\% reduction). Fourier-Transformed Infrared (FTIR) spectra suggest the acceleration is plausibly due to the physical aspects. Furthermore, the FTIR spectra show that MgO can effectively activate the slag and also improve water retention. Rheological tests reveal that FAC addition generally reduces dynamic yield stress and plastic viscosity while increases static yield stress of the fresh mixtures, resulting in lower pumping pressures and higher critical ratios. The mixture with 20 wt\%/40 wt\% FAC addition has 29\%/31\% lower pumping pressure and 78\%/68\% higher critical ratio compared with plain MgO-activated slag material, respectively. Hence, the material with tailored rheology leads to better delivery and deposition performance of the mixture and overall spray-printing quality. An optimal mixture was finally selected based on setting, hydration, rheological properties and spray performance. The developed cementless mixture was successfully applied in the vertical spray-based 3D printing of filament and profile, which confirmed its feasibility in engineering applications.},

However, available materials as well as adaptable design concepts for additional energy-saving insulation layers are not yet convincing in terms of their long term recyclability or variation of shape. Therefore, we investigate the application of foam concrete onto bare walls of existing buildings to gain a façade finish which is highly insulating, easily recyclable and at the same time promises to be individually designable due to the properties of the raw material mixture. To ensure controllable as well as reproducible application and to react to changing working methods in architecture and construction, the research focuses on the automatized application of foam concrete using a robotic setup.},

On the one hand, an evaluation of the thermal and hygric performances of a monitored house with rammed earth walls is provided. This study is completed with laboratory measurements of the thermal and hydric properties of the material. A numerical coupled model, suitable for the specific characteristics of the material, provides a better understanding of the link between the characterization parameters measured and its (hygro)thermal performances. Because of their ability to store and release heat from the sun, their capacity to store moisture and the complexity of the transfers occurring in their pores, earthen walls display many distinctive features that are essential to count for in order to provide an accurate prediction of their impact on the global performances of a building.},

At this level, we minimize combinations of functional and aesthetic objectives under strict fabrication constraints that model the assembly of discrete sets of bent bars.

Unlike other precision-driven fabrication technologies, the authors embrace artistic uncertainty by conducting manual and robotic sculpting experiments and incorporating prominent parameters that affect the fabrication quality. The versatility of the described approach is demonstrated by designing a series of sculpting styles over a wide range of 3D models and robotically fabricating them in clay. Additionally, the paper explores various strategies for designing stylized robotic sculpting patterns by generating toolpaths informed by different techniques.},

These analyses allow for classifying the sampled clay deposits in three categories: clays that can be used unchanged to make CEB (2 clay deposits), clays that are suitable for the manufacture of CEB but require addition of sand and gravel particles (13 clay deposits) and clays that are suitable for the manufacture of CEB if they are mixed with other raw clays (4 clay deposits). In order to verify the use of these clays, five of them served as a model for making CEB. The strength of these bricks was evaluated by testing for compressive strength and abrasion resistance.

The research challenges the flatness of modern, standardized dry wall construction and explores plasterâ€™s malleability as a material that can be applied thick and thin, finished to appear smooth or textured, and tooled while liquid or cured. If the invention of industrialized modern building products such as drywall led to the demise of the plasterer as a tradesperson, our research seeks alliances between the abilities of the human hand and those of automation. By transforming historic methods using new robotic tools, Morphfaux has broadened the possibilities of architectural plaster. While our research has produced forms not possible by human skill alone, it also clearly illustrates a symbiotic relationship between the human body and robotic machines where human dexterity and robotic precision are choreographed in the production of innovative plastering techniques.},

  abstract = {Earth is one of the oldest and till now intensively used natural building material. Around 30\% of the world population still lives or works in buildings constructed out of earth. Most of them dwell in simple huts of rural communities or traditionally hand-crafted buildings. However, a growing number of people looking for healthy, environmentally friendly buildings in so called developed societies experience benefits of earthen construction materials. Due to the hygrothermal potential of clay, these benefits of earthen constructions include evaporative cooling during cooling periods and stable relative humidity levels indoors during the heating season. In addition, earthen building materials may contribute to the urgently needed circular economy, as earthen constructions like earth blocks or earth dry boards are reusable and earth plasters and mortars are replasticisable through the addition of water, as long as no chemical binder is added. Research gaps regarding physical properties, missing standardisation concerning building law and modern construction methods, and a limited number of manufacturers are hindering a wide application of earthen construction worldwide. Meanwhile, new digital production techniques evolve, which may elicit the potential of earth as future building material. Therefore, this Ten Questions article presents the state-of-the art and research gaps related to earth as building material in light of the potential of new digital production techniques like robotic fabrication or additive manufacturing. Such discussion includes new opportunities to combine the natural performance of the material with future-oriented construction systems and a new growing circular economy.},

We present a mapping between the domain of architecture and engineering research and that of the agent models present in the literature. We study the importance of forming diverse teams when aggregating the opinions of different agents for architectural design, and also the effect of having agents optimizing for different factors of a multi-objective optimization design problem. We find that a diverse team of agents is able to provide a higher number of top ranked solutions for the early stage designer to choose from.

  abstract = {Kinematic redundancy occurs when a manipulator possesses more degrees of freedom than those required to execute a given task. Several kinematic techniques for redundant manipulators control the gripper through the pseudo-inverse of the Jacobian, but lead to a kind of chaotic inner motion with unpredictable arm configurations. Such algorithms are not easy to adapt to optimization schemes and, moreover, often there are multiple optimization objectives that can conflict between them. Unlike single optimization, where one attempts to find the best solution, in multi-objective optimization there is no single solution that is optimum with respect to all indices. Therefore, trajectory planning of redundant robots remains an important area of research and more efficient optimization algorithms are needed. This paper presents a new technique to solve the inverse kinematics of redundant manipulators, using a multi-objective genetic algorithm. This scheme combines the closed-loop pseudo-inverse method with a multi-objective genetic algorithm to control the joint positions. Simulations for manipulators with three or four rotational joints, considering the optimization of two objectives in a workspace without and with obstacles are developed. The results reveal that it is possible to choose several solutions from the Pareto optimal front according to the importance of each individual objective.},

  abstract = {The application of lighting simulation techniques for daylight illuminance modelling in architectural spaces is described in this thesis. The prediction tool used for all the work described here is the Radiance lighting simulation system. An overview of the features and capabilities of the Radiance system is presented. Daylight simulation using the Radiance system is described in some detail. The relation between physical quantities and the lighting simulation parameters is made clear in a series of progressively more complex examples. Effective use of the interreflection calculation is described. The illuminance calculation is validated under real sky conditions for a full-size office space. The simulation model used sky luminance patterns that were based directly on measurements. Internal illuminance predictions are compared with measurements for 754 skies that cover a wide range of naturally occurring conditions. The processing of the sky luminance measurements for the lighting simulation is described. The accuracy of the illuminance predictions is shown to be, in the main, comparable with the accuracy of the model input data. There were a number of predictions with low accuracy. Evidence is presented to show that these result from imprecision in the model specification - such as, uncertainty of the circumsolar luminance - rather than the prediction algorithms themselves. Procedures to visualise and reduce illuminance and lighting-related data are presented. The ability of sky models to reproduce measured sky luminance patterns for the purpose of predicting internal illuminance is investigated. Four sky models and two sky models blends are assessed. Predictions of internal illuminance using sky models/blends are compared against those using measured sky luminance patterns. The sky model blends and the Perez All-weather model are shown to perform comparably well. Illuminance predictions using measured skies however were invariably better than those using sky models/blends. Several formulations of the daylight coefficient approach for predicting time varying illuminances are presented. Radiance is used to predict the daylight coefficients from which internal illuminances are derived. The form and magnitude of the daylight coefficients are related to the scene geometry and the discretisation scheme. Internal illuminances are derived for four daylight coefficient formulations based on the measured luminance patterns for the 754 skies. For the best of the formulations, the accuracy of the daylight coefficient derived illuminances is shown to be comparable to that using the standard Radiance calculation method. The use of the daylight coefficient approach to both accurately and efficiently predict hourly internal daylight illuminance levels for an entire year is described. Daylight coefficients are invariant to building orientation for a fixed building configuration. This property of daylight coefficients is exploited to yield hourly internal illuminances for a full year as a function of building orientation. Visual data analysis techniques are used to display and process the massive number of derived illuminances.},

This approach can reveal when solar penetration may occur, say at the summer solstice, but it cannot give a quantitative measure of the degree and likelihood of solar penetration over a representative period of a full year. This paper describes a new image-based technique to quantify the effectiveness of shading devices. It is founded on predictions of direct solar irradiation using hourly meteorological data for a full year. In addition to numerical output, the technique produces synoptic images that reveal the spatial and temporal variation of solar irradiation. There are no practical limits on the scene geometry and buildings with thousands of individual shading elements can be evaluated. The technique is designed to be both fast and highly scalable making it suitable for the evaluation of a large number of design variants. This is demonstrated in the paper using a parametrically defined model of a complex roof shading system based on the Changi Airport Terminal 3 design. The 3600 fins that comprise the roof shading system were generated using a parametric scheme where the fin orientation has a random component. A total of 42 design variants of the roof shading system were evaluated using the new technique.},

This paper presents investigations on the appropriateness of two different methods for production of foam concrete: 1) mixed foaming method in turbulence (colloidal) mixer and 2) mixed foaming method in cavitation disintegrator. Performance of synthetic and protein based foaming agents were examined. The dosage of the foaming agent was varied from 0.7\% to 1.2\% by weight of cement to produce foam concretes with densities ranging between 800 kg/m3 and 1500 kg/m3. The study shows that foaming ability of the designed concrete compositions depends primarily on their w-b ratio. Moreover, foaming with lesser dosage of foaming agent is possible when turbulence mixer is used. Furthermore, mechanical and physical properties of foam concrete, including compressive strength, bending strength, and water absorption were reported.},

Contour evolution algorithms have been extensively used for boundary detection and tracking in computer vision. The standard solution based on partial differential equations and level-sets requires the use of numerical methods of integration that are costly computationally and may have stability issues. We present a morphological approach to contour evolution based on a new curvature morphological operator valid for surfaces of any dimension. We approximate the numerical solution of the curve evolution PDE by the successive application of a set of morphological operators defined on a binary level-set and with equivalent infinitesimal behavior. These operators are very fast, do not suffer numerical stability issues, and do not degrade the level set function, so there is no need to reinitialize it. Moreover, their implementation is much easier since they do not require the use of sophisticated numerical algorithms. We validate the approach providing a morphological implementation of the geodesic active contours, the active contours without borders, and turbopixels. In the experiments conducted, the morphological implementations converge to solutions equivalent to those achieved by traditional numerical solutions, but with significant gains in simplicity, speed, and stability.},

  abstract = {Technological innovation has been an important driving force in architecture, enabling and inspiring architects and engineers by giving them new tools for solving existing problems. In the last two decades, the exploration of digital design and fabrication technologies has stimulated the development of a variety of interests and strategies to materialize increasingly complex and customized solutions in architecture, with traditional building materials.Reinforced concrete is the most widely used material in the building industry today and throughout its history has been the subject of vast research into its performance as a construction material and its tectonic potential in architecture. As such, the introduction of digital fabrication processes in concrete construction represents the biggest prospect for renovation of our built environment and at the same time, presents particular difficulties and opportunities, which are now being addressed. In an effort to investigate the alternative design and material possibilities in concrete emerging from the use of digital fabrication technologies in architecture, this paper proposes a focused view of digital fabrication applied to concrete construction with two areas of research. By framing the research in the context of reference works in concrete architecture of the 20th century, this paper describes and illustrates taxonomy of existing and possible types of integration of digital fabrication technologies in concrete architecture in the realms of Practice and Research.This characterization allows the authors to frame the relation between material, technology and architecture in different environments regarding the same material, extracting a clear image of existing processes, their potential and shortcomings, as well as expectations for future developments.},

  abstract = {Has capitalism stripped us of our common humanity? In an age of fragmented identities and authoritarianism, award-winning journalist Paul Mason calls for a new humanism. Our world order is under pressure as never before. From new authoritarian regimes in the US, Turkey and Russia, to the imminent break-up of the European Union and a social media awash with intolerance, things look set to fall apart just as abruptly as the Soviet Union did some thirty years ago. How did we get here, and what do we do now? In this searching new exploration of our crisis, Paul Mason argues that at its heart lies an attack on the idea of humanity itself. As the free-market system reduced us to two-dimensional consumers, genetics has stripped us of our belief in humans as agents of change. And now the dystopian forces of the authoritarian right are pushing the world towards a pre-modern understanding of the human being: one that aims to destroy the very concept of universal human rights, and create a new world in which we are biologically destined to form hierarchies based on ethnicity and gender, and to obey the demands of religious conformity. If these forces are not stopped, Mason warns, we will relive something even worse than the 1930s. In response, he demands a radical defence of the human being: a reinvention of humanism; a re-assertion of the universality of human rights; and a struggle for a society where biologically determined hierarchies are abolished. We have the power to imagine and design a better system. We must, Mason concludes, reach deep into the history and experience of resistance in order to be our own saviours.},

System specifications and requirements are defined for the operation of the wire at tensions, speed and general conditions similar to the ones optimized for cutting with standard rope wires with beads of the same diameter. Multi-body dynamic simulation parameters are derived from scale homogenization approach. They are used to run multi-body simulation analysis according to the cutting force requirements. Different simulation schemes and approaches are invented to model the effective cutting forces and system dynamic behavior. Constitutive non-linear pseudo-elastic material model is exploited to be utilized in finite element analysis. The results obtained are further used in finite element analysis in order to study the variation of forces among different sections of pseudo-elastic wire. Finally finite element transient analysis is performed to have an insight into the behavior of the wire under time variant loads.},

End-users can easily change parameters of publicly available designs, and 3D-print the customized objects. In research and industry, parametric designs are being used to find optimal, or unique final objects. Unfortunately, for most designs, many combinations of parameter values are invalid. Restricting the parameter space of designs to only the valid configurations is a difficult problem. Most publicly available designs do not contain this information. Using ideas from program analysis, we synthesize constraints on parameters of parametric designs. Some constraints are synthesized statically, by exploiting implicit assumptions of the design process. Several others are inferred by evaluating the design on many different samples, and then constructing and solving hypotheses. Our approach is effective at finding constraints on parameter values for a wide variety of parametric designs, with a very small runtime cost, in the order of seconds.},

  abstract = {Additive Manufacturing in Construction (AMC) provides the possibility to print objects in unprecedented and novel ways, pushing the boundaries of what was previously possible in construction. Nonetheless, this requires an adequate and accurate co-registration of the digital representation of the printed object (as-built) with its digital model (as-designed) in order to achieve a robust quality control (QC). Most common automatic approaches are based on ICP-like distance minimization algorithm and target-based direct transformation. ICP suffers from the local minima problem and might take relatively large time to converge. Accordingly, we describe an experimental test specifically designed to underscore problems posed by objects with ambiguous surface structure which renders ICP unsuccessful. In order to overcome these shortcomings, we established a reference surveying network and transformed it to the robot (model) coordinate system. In this way, all future measurements could be transformed to the same coordinate as our as-designed model which is a pre-requisite for further inspections. The overall registration quality resulted in an RMSE of 3 mm.},

  abstract = {While the rising trend of research in robotic fabrication has furthered the development of parametric or mass-customization concepts in architecture, the majority of these projects are still cut or assembled from standardized blocks of material. Although the use of nonstandard, ‘found’ components provides an additional layer of complexity and constraint to the design/fabrication process, it can compensate for these challenges by enabling more sustainable material practices and the production of unique objects that cannot be reproduced. In this chapter, we illustrate a materially efficient technique for designing and fabricating freeform surfaces within the constraints of irregular wood flitches. The process utilizes a robotically operated bandsaw to cut a series of curved strips which, when rotated and laminated, can approximate doubly-curved and digitally defined geometry. By delimiting the design space by both the ‘machinic morphospace’ (Menges in Rob|Arch 2012: Robotic Fabrication in Architecture, Art and Industrial Design, Springer, Vienna, pp. 28–47, 2012) of the fabrication technique and the naturally defined curvatures and constraints of the flitch, the customized control software and machining processes confer the capabilities of digital fabrication onto materially tailored and operator-informed woodcraft.},

Structural shells, particularly gridshells, have a long history but due to their complexity and the accompanying high cost of construction, their application has been limited. The research proposes a method for integrating the design and fabrication processes such that complex double curved reticulated frames can be constructed efficiently, from prefabricated components, requiring significantly less formwork than is typical. A significant aspect of the method has been the development of software tools that allow for both algorithmic formfinding and the direct control of robotic fabrication equipment from within the same modelling package. A recent case-study is examined where the methodology has been applied to construct a reticulated shell structure in the form of a partial vault. Components were prefabricated using 6-axis robotic fabrication equipment. Individual parts are designed such that the assembly of components guides the form of the vault, requiring no centring to create the desired shape. Algorithmically generated machine instructions controlled a sequence of three tool changes for each part, using a single modular fixture, greatly increasing accuracy. The complete integration of computational design techniques and fabrication methodologies now enables the economical deployment of non-uniform structurally optimised reticulated frames. © 2012, Association for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia (CAADRIA), Hong Kong.},

We used a range of micro- and bench-scale methods to understand the fire behaviour of different types of façade product, including those used on the Tower, in order to explain the speed, ferocity and lethality of the fire. Compared to the least flammable panels, polyethylene-aluminium composites showed 55x greater peak heat release rates (pHRR) and 70x greater total heat release (THR), while widely-used high-pressure laminate panels showed 25x greater pHRR and 115x greater THR. Compared to the least combustible insulation products, polyisocyanurate foam showed 16x greater pHRR and 35x greater THR, while phenolic foam showed 9x greater pHRR and 48x greater THR. A few burning drips of polyethylene from the panelling are enough to ignite the foam insulation, providing a novel explanation for rapid flame-spread within the facade. Smoke from polyisocyanurates was 15x, and phenolics 5x more toxic than from mineral wool insulation. 1kg of burning polyisocyanurate insulation is sufficient to fill a 50m3 room with an incapacitating and ultimately lethal effluent. Simple, additive models are proposed, which provide the same rank order as BS8414 large-scale regulatory tests.},

While the functionalities of various types of reinforcement are briefly addressed, the major focus is on the integration process as such, i.e., on its technological aspects. On this basis a generic classification and process description outline has been developed for reinforcement integration, which is regarded as an extension of the RILEM process classification framework for Digital Fabrication with Concrete (DFC). In many instances, the integration occurs in a separate process step prior to or after concrete shaping. This holds true for all formative digital concrete shaping processes and for many 3DCP solutions. 3DCP approaches enable, however, integration of the reinforcement during concrete shaping as part of a single-step AM process in a simultaneous or contiguous manner, while placement of reinforcement is considered to be a sub-process.}

The most commonly used stabilizer is cement, which reinforces earth by enhancing its strength and water resistance with chemical bonds, while at the same time significantly increases its embodied energy and reduces its sorption capacity. These side-effects greatly reduce the sustainability appeal of earthen materials, leading to a contradiction in this application of cement. Since the researcher community has been aware of this more and more results are published of experiments with alternative stabilizers. This review provides an overview of research about the durability of stabilized earthen walls, the methods used to assess it and parameters that have been shown to affect it. The review features a brief history of this field, but focuses more on recently published data about the water erosion performance of stabilized earthen construction materials. Conclusions about the existing test methods are drawn, with directions for further development suggested.},

  abstract = {Cement-stabilised rammed earth (CSRE) reinforced with steel is a modern adaptation of an ancient construction technique, permitting the use of a wider range of structural forms and applications than those used traditionally. However, corrosion behaviour of steel embedded in CSRE is not yet understood, casting doubt on the longevity of these structural solutions. In this paper, we assessed the ability of a range of CSRE mixes stabilised with 10\% cement to protect embedded steel against carbonation-induced corrosion by using electrochemical measurements and considering also material alkalinity, carbonation resistance and capillary absorption. Results demonstrated that the pH of the CSRE mixes was sufficiently alkaline to provide the appropriate environment for passivation of steel reinforcement. Based on the experimental results, carbonation would most likely have reached the reinforcement within approximately 5–15\,years (50\,mm cover) or 30–75\,years (150\,mm cover), depassivating the reinforcement within the design life span. The findings demonstrated that a corrosion potential of −200\,mV SCE indicates conditions of negligible corrosion of steel in CSRE. As behaviour varied little between the four tested soil mixes (of varying granularity), it is reasonable to expect that findings presented here also apply to other soil mixes stabilised with 10\% cement.},

  abstract = {"In het publieke debat is in de loop der jaren veel kritiek geleverd op het neoliberalisme, maar wat dit neoliberalisme precies inhoudt, blijft meestal vaag. We denken al snel aan Thatcher en Reagan en aan het ruwe Anglo-Amerikaanse kapitalisme. Nederland kent echter een eigen neoliberale traditie, die veel verder teruggaat dan tot nu toe werd gedacht. Bram Mellink en Merijn Oudenampsen onderzoeken de oorsprong en de invloed van het neoliberalisme in Nederland. Hun zoektocht voert ver buiten de Haagse kaasstolp en begint al in de jaren vijftig, toen Friedrich Hayek en een kleine club geestverwanten een nieuwe economische filosofie verkondigden: het neoliberalisme. Volgens hen moest de overheid het marktmechanisme niet corrigeren, maar juist actief aanjagen. De Nederlandse neoliberalen richtten geen eigen politieke partij op, maar voerden een ideeënstrijd bínnen bestaande partijen en instellingen. Wat behelsde dit neoliberalisme? Welk stempel drukte het op de politiek en op de beleidsvorming? Bram Mellink (1985) is historicus aan de Universiteit van Amsterdam. Merijn Oudenampsen (1979) is als socioloog en politicoloog verbonden aan de Université Libre de Bruxelles. De afgelopen jaren deden zij samen onderzoek naar de geschiedenis van het neoliberalisme in Nederland."-- Back cover},

  abstract = {The construction sector has evolved a lot over the last few years promoting the design and manufacturing of innovative and environmentally sustainable materials and products. In accordance with European and national guidelines, with a growing awareness of environmental issues several experiences are showing the interest of companies to qualify their products as green and environmentally sustainable. In the European context many directives have been introduced which, among their themes, speak of circular economy, reduction of the use of resources, better efficiency of production, etc. At the same time, initiatives related to the GPP were activated in the Italian context, that foresee an increase of the recycled content in building materials. Especially the brick manufacturing industry is very sensitive to the issue of the waste recovery and many experiences show that is possible to obtain optimum products with weighted material mixes (virgin raw materials and secondary raw materials). This procedure also contributes to a gradual recovery of waste otherwise disposed of in landfills. In the international scenario there are many studies about the reuse of waste and scraps in the bricks material mixes; the studies mainly derive from heterogeneous sectors as, for example: fly ash from coal plants, scraps and waste from the natural stone extraction, ceramic production residue, aggregates from demolition, waste oil, slag from steel mills, sawmill sludge and dust, glass powdered, recycled plastic, textile fibers, etc. The analysis of many experiences highlighted two key issues: the importance of cross-sectorial exchanges as a condition for enabling strategies of circular economy and the high intrinsic value of the material scrap. Particular attention has been paid to the Catalyst case study, a company that has developed different types of bricks, produced almost entirely with secondary raw material.},

IEC 61499 is a new standard for distributed measurement and control systems, that enables portability and interoperability of embedded controllers, along with the ease of their mapping to arbitrary distributed networking hardware configurations. This paper demonstrates that the IEC 61499 reference architecture can be successfully used to create a computer numeric controller, offering interoperability, portability, configurability, and distribution characteristics. The layered CNC-FB architecture is proposed, which simplifies the design of a CNC machine controller with the architecture layers responsible for data processing, data storage and execution. In combination with the object-oriented Model-View-Control design pattern, the CNC-FB architecture supports the design framework, in which simulation of the machining becomes natural and inherent part of the design process, with seamless transition from simulation to actual machining. The implemented controller was tested in both the model and on an actual milling machine.},

Despite being revered for his novel approach towards material assembly, there remains a void in the historical understanding of Lewerentz's construction methods given the works were largely manifested through a process of on-site management and design, rather than through drawings alone. The built artifacts possess traces of this knowledge, but it is possible to fill historical voids and contribute to a comprehensive understanding of Lewerentz's construction practices through the physical reproduction of his works. This paper proposes a method of scaled-construction whereby researchers re-create specific masonry techniques, using photographs, dimensional drawings, and historical accounts, to resurrect knowledge currently trapped within the brick. Through this method the logic of certain geometric operations and patterns emerge. The process unearths critical insight into the unique reciprocity between thinking and making in Lewerentz's work. What begins a void becomes an opportunity for engaging the physical processes that define the architect's contribution. This paper employs a method of knowledge extraction through physical making, which has the potential to flesh out a better collective understanding of Sigurd Lewerentz's work as well as an application to better understand the works of other master architect/builders, whose techniques demand some form of action to bring them to light.},

  abstract = {The introduction of robotic arms in additive manufacturing enables the scaling up of three-dimensional (3D) printing processes and the realization of nonplanar path geometries. As a result, novel design potential is unlocked by having control over the layered configuration of paths in the object, and 3D printing becomes viable for architectural applications. However, the various challenges associated with creating feasible nonplanar layered paths for the realization of large-scale objects are hindering their integration in the design process and broad use. This work presents methods that contribute to the flexible and intuitive design of nonplanar layered paths for robotic printing. We focus on the challenges related to the realization of single-shell bifurcating structures, with emphasis on the paths' behavior on the bifurcating moments of the shapes. Our methods are based on the use of design techniques that originate from implicit shape representation and on the detection of critical points on the surface through the lens of distance functions. We present fabricated prototypes printed with nonplanar paths that showcase the possibilities of our methods.},

The advent of robotic arms has created great potential in the 3D printing industry for the realization of non-planar print paths that allow transitioning between different orientations during the print. However, this potential is often not fully realized due to the various challenges associated with the design of feasible non-planar print paths. Inspired by the ubiquitous key-framing technique in animation, where an input of limited degrees of freedom is used to describe a complex behavior, we propose a method to generate non-planar layered print paths subject to the input of the designer, by specifying a series of target curves on the surface of a mesh. Our method generates intermediary print paths with a direction that interpolates that of the targets while respecting the sequence and distances between neighboring paths imposed by fabrication constraints. The resulting print paths have variable layer height, and their realization relies on variable end-effector orientation. We present several examples and fabricated prototypes and make qualitative comparisons to planar slicing, to showcase the capabilities of our method.},

  abstract = {Augmented bricklaying explores the manual construction of intricate brickwork through visual augmentation, and applies and validates the concept in a real-scale building project—a fair-faced brickwork facade for a winery in Greece. As shown in previous research, robotic systems have proven to be very suitable to achieve various differentiated brickwork designs with high efficiency but show certain limitations, for example, in regard to spatial freedom or the usage of mortar on site. Hence, this research aims to show that through the use of a craft-specific augmented reality system, the same geometric complexity and precision seen in robotic fabrication can be achieved with an augmented manual process. Towards this aim, a custom-built augmented reality system for in situ construction was established. This process allows bricklayers to not depend on physical templates, and it enables enhanced spatial freedom, preserving and capitalizing on the bricklayer’s craft of mortar handling. In extension to conventional holographic representations seen in current augmented reality fabrication processes that have limited context-awareness and insufficient geometric feedback capabilities, this system is based on an object-based visual–inertial tracking method to achieve dynamic optical guidance for bricklayers with real-time tracking and highly precise 3D registration features in on-site conditions. By integrating findings from the field of human–computer interfaces and human–machine communication, this research establishes, explores, and validates a human–computer interactive fabrication system, in which explicit machine operations and implicit craftsmanship knowledge are combined. In addition to the overall concept, the method of implementation, and the description of the project application, this paper also quantifies process parameters of the applied augmented reality assembly method concerning building accuracy and assembly speed. In the outlook, this paper aims to outline future directions and potential application areas of object-aware augmented reality systems and their implications for architecture and digital fabrication.},

  abstract = {This paper presents Interactive Robotic Plastering (IRoP), a system enabling designers and skilled workers to engage intuitively with an in-situ robotic plastering process. The research combines three elements: interactive design tools, an augmented reality interface, and a robotic spraying system. Plastering is a complex process relying on tacit knowledge and craftsmanship, making it difficult to simulate and automate. However, our system utilizes a controller-based interaction system to enable diverse users to interactively create articulated plasterwork in-situ. A customizable computational toolset converts human intentions into robotic motions while respecting robotic and material constraints. To accomplish this, we developed both an interactive computational model to translate the data from a motion-tracking system into robotic trajectories using design and editing tools as well as an audio-visual guidance system for in-situ projection. We then conducted two user-studies of designers and skilled workers who used IRoP to design and fabricate a full-scale demonstrator.},

  abstract = {Despite, the innovation of additive manufacturing (AM) technology, and in spite of the existence of natural bio-materials offering notable mechanical properties, materials used for AM are not necessarily more sustainable than materials used in traditional manufacturing. Furthermore, potential material savings may be partially overshadowed by the relative toxicity of the material and binders used for AM during fabrication and post-fabrication processes, as well as the energy usage necessary for the production and processing workflow. Soil as a building material offers a cheap, sustainable alternative to non-degradable material systems, and new developments in earth construction show how earthen buildings can create light, progressive, and sustainable structures. Nevertheless, existing large-scale earthen construction methods can only produce highly simplified shapes with rough detailing. This research proposes to use robotic additive manufacturing processes to overcome current limitations of constructing with earth, supporting complex three-dimensional geometries, and the creation of novel organic composites. More specifically the research focuses on robotic binder-jetting with granular bio-composites and non-toxic binding agents such as hydrogels. This paper is divided into two main sections: (1) biodegradable material system, and (2) multi-move robotic process, and describes the most crucial fabrication parameters such as compaction pressure, density of binders, deposition strategies and toolpath planning as well as identifying the architectural implications of using this novel biodegradable fabrication process. The combination of soil and hydrogel as building material shows the potential of a fully reversible construction process for architectural components and foresees its potential full-scale architectural implementations.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the development of sustainable building earth-based materials. More precisely, it addresses the study of the reinforcement of raw earth with natural fibres originated from Algeria (diss and date palm tree fibres) and their stabilisation with xanthan gum. The aim of this study is the design of extruded earth-based building blocks with improved mechanical properties such as compressive strength and ductility. The effects of separate and simultaneous addition of date palm trees or diss fibres (with length varying between 5 and 15 mm at dosages of 1.5 and 3\% in volume) and stabiliser (xanthan gum and HMP at 1 and 2\% of the dry earth mass) on the flexural and compressive strength of the stabilised and unstabilised extruded materials are compared. Results show that adding only fibers decreases the compressive strength of the earth in comparison with the unreinforced sample. It is also shown that diss fibres provides better reinforcing efficiency than date palm tree fibres and that a combined addition of xanthan gum and natural fibres create a synergic effect that greatly improved the material mechanical behaviour: higher compressive and tensile strengths and better ductile properties. These results are fully supported by microscopic observations and pull-out tests carried out on single fibres.},

  abstract = {The need for a vast quantity of new buildings to address the increase in population and living standards is opposed to the need for tackling global warming and the decline in biodiversity. To overcome this twofold challenge, there is a need to move towards a more circular economy by widely using a combination of alternative low-carbon construction materials, alternative technologies and practices. Soils or earth were widely used by builders before World War II, as a primary resource to manufacture materials and structures of vernacular architecture. Centuries of empirical practices have led to a variety of techniques to implement earth, known as rammed earth, cob and adobe masonry among others. Earth refers to local soil with a variable composition but at least containing a small percentage of clay that would simply solidify by drying without any baking. This paper discusses why and how earth naturally embeds high-tech properties for sustainable construction. Then the potential of earth to contribute to addressing the global challenge of modern architecture and the need to re-think building practices is also explored. The current obstacles against the development of earthen architecture are examined through a survey of current earth building practitioners in Western Europe. A literature review revealed that, surprisingly, only technical barriers are being addressed by the scientific community; two-thirds of the actual barriers identified by the interviewees are not within the technical field and are almost entirely neglected in the scientific literature, which may explain why earthen architecture is still a niche market despite embodying all the attributes of the best construction material to tackle the current climate and economic crisis.},

  abstract = {The development of affordable housing is necessary due to the numerous homeless people living in developing countries; the present work is an attempt to alleviate the housing problem facing populations of these countries. Building with Compressed Earthen Blocks (CEBs) is becoming more popular due to their low cost and relative abundance of materials. The proposed innovative Banana-Compressed Earth Block (B-CEB) consists of ordinary CEB ingredients plus banana fibers, which will be the focus of this study. Banana fibers are widely available worldwide due to agricultural waste from banana cultivation. Additionally, banana fibers are environmentally friendly and present important attributes, such as low density, light weight, low cost, high tensile strength, as well as being water repellent and fire resistant. This kind of waste has a greater chance of being utilized for different applications in construction and building materials in order to enhance the mechanical properties of the CEBs. Such enhancements will raise the number of storeys of a building that can be built with CEBs. Experimental work studies on the classic CEB with no fibers and B-CEB were performed, including an axial compression test and flexural test (three-point bending test) by using testing methods according to American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards (ASTM C-67). Also, in order to obtain the load-deflection curve and bending modulus (E) from the flexural test, the Linear Variable Differential Transformer (LVDT) sensor was placed under the mid-span of the block for vertical displacement measurements. The results of this study will highlight general trends in the strength properties of different design mixes by adding different lengths of banana fibers in the CEBs. These efforts are necessary to ensure that B-CEB technology becomes a more widely accepted building material that will verify the earth building technology for offering affordable houses.},

  abstract = {The ancient vaulting techniques from drylands are an excellent inspiration for applying robotic 3D printing of a large-scale structure since they have solutions to fabricate earthen vaults in sustainable manners. The precision of the advanced hardware accompanied by software potential for managing vast and complex data opens a wide range of possibilities for constructing environmental-aware and affordable structures. In pursuit of the previous explorations in [1] for scaffold-free 3D printing methods, this paper explores the case study of a double-layered vault. The double-layered vaults have some advantages over thin shells, such as thermal resistance. For the 3D Printing concerns, the double-layered earthen shell stands better than thin shells in reaction to the structure self-weight. The chosen extrusion paste is the Kaolinite clay mixture. The research's main objective is gathering the following information during the printing process: First, to analyse and investigate geometries stable with fresh clay. Second, to assay the effect of shell cross-section optimisation on the structure's strength. Third, to evaluate the effect of different slicing strategies on the structure's stability. Fourth, to deliberately squeeze the clay laces (Layer Pressing Strategy). Fifth, to evaluate the effect of Lace Heating Strategy on the stability of the structure. Finally, two clay prototypes is successfully 3D printed using a 7-axis robot and a clay extruder to prove the validity of the strategy. Figure 1 shows the double-layered shell's sequential layers with varying cross-sections widths. Figure 1 Successive cross-sections of the double-layered shell},

  abstract = {The focus in reducing environmental impacts of buildings is shifting from the operational stage to the full life cycle, with particular attention to embodied greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of construction materials. The application of bio-based construction materials is promoted for potentially reducing material-related embodied GHG and even enabling carbon fixation. In part one of this study (1/2), we apply life cycle assessment (LCA) to critically examine regenerative design strategies, starting by investigating embodied GHG emissions as well as other environmental impact indicators of different bio-based building element variants – assessing timber-, straw- and hemp-based solutions - in a European context. The results show that bio-based building elements tend to have considerably lower embodied GHG emissions than conventional solutions, e.g., brick or concrete-based elements. Analyzing the environmental hotspots across the life cycle of selected bio-based construction options, we identify their most contributing environmental indicators to be global warming potential (GWP), particulate matter (PM) and land use (LU); and the most important life cycle stages to be material production, maintenance and replacement, particularly of finishes. To investigate carbon removal potentials, we calculated biogenic carbon contents of selected bio-based options, identifying straw-based building elements as the most promising solution due to high biogenic carbon content and fast (yearly) re-growth cycles. Our study highlights the environmental potentials of using bio-based construction solutions to substitute conventional building materials. In addition, the study identifies important environmental trade-offs within bio-based material alternatives that demand consideration and further study in future research.},

Drawing upon art, science, philosophy, and the history of culture, Lewis Mumford explained the origin of the machine age and traced its social results, asserting that the development of modern technology had its roots in the Middle Ages rather than the Industrial Revolution. Mumford sagely argued that it was the moral, economic, and political choices we made, not the machines that we used, that determined our then industrially driven economy. Equal parts powerful history and polemic criticism, Technics and Civilization was the first comprehensive attempt in English to portray the development of the machine age over the last thousand years—and to predict the pull the technological still holds over us today.  “The questions posed in the first paragraph of Technics and Civilization still deserve our attention, nearly three quarters of a century after they were written.”—Journal of Technology and Culture},

PyRobot aims to provide a research ecosystem with convenient access to robotics datasets, algorithm implementations and models that can be used to quickly create a state-of-the-art baseline.

  abstract = {Alkali activated binders-often referred to as geopolymers-have been studied extensively over the last years and have emerged as alternatives to Portland cement binders. The alkali activated binders are considered eco-friendly and durable. However, they normally require thermal curing to gain acceptable strength. Further, due to the high alkalinity and caustic nature of the binders (containing a blend of alkali silicate and highly concentrated alkali hydroxide), precautions must be taken when handling these materials on site. Both the thermal curing requirement and the handling risk exclude these interesting binders to be used in sprayed concrete. The ultimate goal of the present study is to develop a fly ash binder for sprayed concrete. This binder does not contain the caustic alkali hydroxide (only the alkali silicate), which makes the binder substantially less caustic. To achieve acceptable setting times and early age strength at ambient temperature, an accelerator has been developed. Set times in the same range as for normal Portland cement based binders have been measured and early age compressive strengths similar to 'normal' sprayed concrete have been obtained. Simple laboratory tests indicated that these binder are extremely resistant to fire and chemical attack. A grout made of silica flour, fly ash and sodium silicate set fast and developed high early age strength when sprayed at ambient temperature. BACKGROUND AND SCOPE OF RESEARCH},

Among all, the area of construction manufacturing has been challenged by the involvement of computational means. On one hand, the introduction of digital fabrication machinery has questioned the typical distinction between design and construction. On the other hand, digital manufacturing required the rethinking of design, toward the idea of “design for manufacturing”. Cyber-physical is about linking design, manufacturing, and construction into a seamless process, which is data-driven (1); automated (2); and adaptive through feedback loops (3). In this light, the chapter has a dual scope. Firstly, it discusses the concept of Construction 4.0—which is a contextualization of a more generalized Industry 4.0 paradigm into the specificities of the field. Secondly, it provides an overview of digital manufacturing—with a particular focus on state-of-the-art research and transfer toward practice. The focus is on emerging applications in architectural and construction robotics, mainly referring to the opportunity for off-site manufacturing and digital prefabrication. A discussion on the technology and workflows for enabling Construction 4.0 is presented, to inspire a future research agenda capable of unfolding the full potential of such an approach to design and construction.},

An alternative open-source fabrication ecosystem is gradually developing and challenging the actual production logics and, as consequence, the social organization. The discipline of architecture is a protagonist of this revolution. The imminent diffusion of new productive systems, along with the development of advanced software, allow new possibilities to connect the domains of design and construction, and to realize components given a certain (algorithmic) description, and to synthetically describe the physical environment and its behaviours within the digital environment. The role of the designer in this phase is to extend the potential of the CAD/CAM procedures, and re-appropriate the control in the design-toconstruction process to once again engage in the actual manufacturing of building construction and provide high performance, tailored architecture. The open network of digital production supports new design collaborations and manufacturing logics which are able to reconfigure the urban organization of the industrial system and the interaction with citizens, as in the experimental planning of Fab City Barcelona. The use of open-source software and hardware opens up new horizons for more transparent and collaborative development of interventions at different scales and throughout the various stages of the projects formation.},

All of the tests were done on the same soil-cement mixture. On this basis, it was determined which of the methods of durability assessment is more and which is less restrictive. A new method for assessing the durability of CSRE in a humid continental climate has been proposed, which is the frost resistance test. This test is determined by the method that is described in the national annex of the European concrete standard of one of the temperate climate countries. The article also shows that a minimum of 9\% of the cement additive and a soil mixture containing a gravel fraction are required, in order to ensure adequate rammed earth durability in a humid continental climate (i.e., frost resistance).},

As a step toward achieving controlled manipulation with flexible structures, we introduce the problem of approximating desired quasi-static deformations of a flexible beam, modeled as an elastica, by optimizing the loads applied. We presume the loads to be concentrated, with the number and nature of their application prescribed based on design considerations and operational constraints. For each desired deformation, we pose the problem of computing the requisite set of loads to mimic the target shape as one of optimal approximations. In the process, we introduce a novel generalization of the forward problem by considering the inclinations of the loads applied to be functionals of the solution.

  abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to present a CAD-based human-robot interface that allows non-expert users to teach a robot in a manner similar to that used by human beings to teach each other. Design/methodology/approach – Intuitive robot programming is achieved by using CAD drawings to generate robot programs off-line. Sensory feedback allows minimization of the effects of uncertainty, providing information to adjust the robot paths during robot operation. Findings – It was found that it is possible to generate a robot program from a common CAD drawing and run it without any major concerns about calibration or CAD model accuracy. Research limitations/implications – A limitation of the proposed system has to do with the fact that it was designed to be used for particular technological applications. Practical implications – Since most manufacturing companies have CAD packages in their facilities today, CAD-based robot programming may be a good option to program robots without the need for skilled robot programmers. Originality/value – The paper proposes a new CAD-based robot programming system. Robot programs are directly generated from a CAD drawing “running” on a commonly available 3D CAD package (Autodesk Inventor) and not from a commercial, computer aided robotics (CAR) software, making it a simple CAD integrated solution. This is a low-cost and low-setup time system where no advanced robot programming skills are required to operate it. In summary, robot programs are generated with a high-level of abstraction from the robot language.},

We fuse all of the depth data streamed from a Kinect sensor into a single global implicit surface model of the observed scene in real-time. The current sensor pose is simultaneously obtained by tracking the live depth frame relative to the global model using a coarse-to-fine iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, which uses all of the observed depth data available. We demonstrate the advantages of tracking against the growing full surface model compared with frame-to-frame tracking, obtaining tracking and mapping results in constant time within room sized scenes with limited drift and high accuracy. We also show both qualitative and quantitative results relating to various aspects of our tracking and mapping system. Modelling of natural scenes, in real-time with only commodity sensor and GPU hardware, promises an exciting step forward in augmented reality (AR), in particular, it allows dense surfaces to be reconstructed in real-time, with a level of detail and robustness beyond any solution yet presented using passive computer vision.},

However, current approaches remain limited to printing on top of a flat build bed. This limits robotic 3D printing’s impact as a sustainable technology: opportunities to customize or enhance existing elements, or to utilize complex material behaviour are missed. This paper addresses the potentials of conformal 3D printing and presents a novel and robust workflow for printing onto unknown and arbitrarily shaped 3D substrates. The workflow combines dual-resolution Robotic Scanning, Neural Network prediction and printing of PETG plastic. This integrated approach offers the advantage of responding directly to unknown geometries through automated performance design customization. This paper firstly contextualizes the work within the current state of the art of conformal printing. We then describe our methodology and the design experiment we have used to test it. We lastly describe the key findings, potentials and limitations of the work, as well as the next steps in this research.},

Where digital tools are seldom used in the fabrication of GFRC molds, and expert craftsmen are not digital experts, our implementation of automated registration and feedback processes enables craftsmen to be integrated into and gain value from the digital production chain. In this paper, we describe the in-progress framework, Precision Partner, which connects 3d scanning and point cloud registration of geometrically complex and varied one off elements to factory floor dimensional feedback. We firstly introduce the production context of GFRC molds, as well as industry standards for production feedback. We then detail our methods, and report the results of a case study that tests the framework on the case of a balcony element},

  abstract = {Although they are very efficient structures, concrete shells have lost popularity due to the complexity of the traditional construction process using cast-in-place concrete. A key concept to overcome the labor-intensive formwork in situ is the segmentation of the shells into prefabricated parts. In order to avoid individual formworks during prefabrication as well, the authors rely on extrusion-based 3D printing of strain-hardening cement-based composite (SHCC). The goal is a highly automated, scalable, and adaptable flow-prefabrication of modules controlled by a holistic digital design process. Such the creation of modular free-form shell structures can be accelerated significantly, resulting in structures comparable with gridshells. Starting with the problem statement and the elaboration of the technology used, the main contribution of this research is the development of geometrical methods for modularization based on given production conditions. The challenge lies in the free-form geometry discretization with respect to the structural analysis and within the defined constraints such as planar quads, no edge torsion, and minimal material consumption. Methods of discrete differential geometry for circular PQ (planar quad) mesh generation are combined with Response Surface Methodology (RSM) for multi-objective optimization of the global parameterized shape. The results were illustrated in a study case where the geometrical and structural production parameters of starting and final shell are compared.}

From the sixteenth to the twentieth century, urban farmers grew Mediterranean fruits and vegetables as far north as England and the Netherlands, using only renewable energy. These crops were grown surrounded by massive "fruit walls", which stored the heat from the sun and released it at night, creating a microclimate that could increase the temperature by more than 10°C (18°F). Later, greenhouses built against the fruit walls further improved yields from solar energy alone. It was only at the very end of the nineteenth century that...},

  abstract = {On 14 June 2017, a high-rise fire broke out in the 24-storey Grenfell Tower block of flats in North Kensington, West London, at 00:54 BST. 72 people died, including two who later died in hospital, with more than 70 others being injured and 223 people escaping. It was the deadliest structural fire in the United Kingdom since the 1988 Piper Alpha oil-platform disaster and the worst UK residential fire since World War II. The fire was started by an electrical fault in a refrigerator on the fourth floor. It spread rapidly up the building's exterior, bringing fire and smoke to all the residential floors. This was due to the building's new cladding and the external insulation, since the air gap between them enabled the stack effect. The fire burned for about 60 hours before finally being extinguished. More than 250 London Fire Brigade firefighters and 70 fire engines from stations across London were involved in efforts to control the fire and rescue residents. More than 100 London Ambulance Service crews on at least 20 ambulances attended the scene, joined by specialist paramedics from the Ambulance Service's Hazardous Area Response Team. The Metropolitan Police and London's Air Ambulance also assisted the rescue effort. The Grenfell Tower Inquiry began on 14 September 2017 to investigate the causes of the fire and other related issues. Findings from the first report of the inquiry were released in October 2019 and addressed the events of the night. It affirmed that the building's exterior did not comply with regulations and was the central reason why the fire spread, and that the fire service were too late in advising residents to evacuate. A second phase to investigate the broader causes began on the third anniversary in 2020. As of June 2020, the fire is currently being investigated by the police, a public inquiry, and coroner's inquests. Among the issues being investigated are the management of the building by the Kensington and Chelsea London Borough Council and Kensington and Chelsea TMO (or KCTMO, which was responsible for the borough's council housing) and the responses of the Fire Brigade, the council and other government agencies. In the aftermath of the fire, the council's leader, deputy leader and chief executive resigned, and the council took direct control of council housing from the KCTMO. The national government commissioned an independent review of building regulations and fire safety, which published a report in May 2018. Across the UK and in some other countries, local governments have investigated other tower blocks to find those that have similar cladding. Efforts to replace the cladding on these buildings are ongoing.},

GSM4Q offered an important vehicle to disseminate the current most innovative developments in the field of architectural engineering. The participants of the conference, both practitioners and students. GSM4Q aimed to inform and stimulate the Qatar based construction industries and their experts to adopt the new robotic methods of design, manufacturing and building. For the Qatar industries, it meant a further shift of focus towards the digital and towards 3D and 4D thinking, designing and manufacturing, as to promote new industries and encourage further economic diversification. The theme of the Game Set and Match IV Qatar [GSM4Q] conference is “Connecting People, Spaces and Machines”, with as the subtheme ‘The Informed Nomadic Monad’. GSM4Q topics were structured along the lines of the scalability of the connections between constituting monadic components. Leading themes for the conference sessions are 1] Informed Nomadic Swarms, 2] Nomadic Cities and Buildings, 3] Monads and Nomads, and 4] Scalable Interaction with Inclusive approach with respect to tradition and modernity, but representing the natural form of the next generation building. Day One | The Nomad session labelled “Universe / Planet” and Day Two | The Monad focused more on the realized state of the art buildings in Doha and elsewhere.},

  doi = {10.1007/s00158-021-03019-6},
  abstract = {Structural optimization within concrete construction has been increasingly taken up in research within the last two decades. Possible drivers are the need for material-reduced and thus resource-efficient structures as well as recent advancements in automated concrete construction. However, structural concrete is characterized by nonlinear material behavior. Consequently, the merge of structural concrete design and topology optimization is not trivial. This paper reviews and assesses the topic of topology optimization within concrete construction, carrying out an extensive quantitative as well as qualitative review on practical and numerical applications. The following research areas are identified: Multimaterial modeling, stress constraints, concrete damage modeling, strut and tie modeling, combined truss-continuum topology optimization, the consideration of multiple load cases, a focus on construction techniques and alternative approaches. Although the number of research papers dealing with the topic of topology optimization in concrete construction is numerous, there are only few that actually realized topology optimized concrete structures. In addition, only a little number of experiments was performed for an objective evaluation of the found geometries so far. Concluding this review, a list of future challenges, like the incorporation of sustainability measurements within the optimization process, is given and thus serves as a guidance for subsequent research.},

  abstract = {Generative product design systems used in the context of mass customization are required to generate diverse solutions quickly and reliably without necessitating modification or tuning during use. When such systems are employed to allow for the mass customization of product form, they must be able to handle mass production and engineering constraints that can be time-consuming to evaluate and difficult to fulfill. These issues are related to how the constraints are handled in the generative design system. This article evaluates two promising sequential constraint-handling techniques and the often used weighted sum technique with regard to convergence time, convergence rate, and diversity of the design solutions. The application used for this purpose was a design system aimed at generating a table with an advanced form: a Voronoi diagram based structure. The design problem was constrained in terms of production as well as stability, requiring a time-consuming finite element evaluation. Regarding convergence time and rate, one of the sequential constraint-handling techniques performed significantly better than the weighted sum technique. Nevertheless, the weighted sum technique presented respectable results and therefore remains a relevant technique. Regarding diversity, none of the techniques could generate diverse solutions in a single search run. In contrast, the solutions from different searches were always diverse. Solution diversity is thus gained at the cost of more runs, but no evaluation of the diversity of the solutions is needed. This result is important, because a diversity evaluation function would otherwise have to be developed for every new type of design. Efficient handling of complex constraints is an important step toward mass customization of nontrivial product forms.},

The error model takes into account all possible geometric errors (25 geometric error parameters to be identified through optimization, in addition to the pose parameters for the base and tool frames and four error parameters related to the compliance in joints 2, 3, 4 and 5. The least squares optimization technique is used to find the 29 error parameters that best fit the measures acquired with a laser tracker. Contrary to most other similar works, the validation of the robot’s accuracy is performed with a very large number of measures (1,000) throughout the complete robot’s joint space. After calibration, the mean/maximum position errors at any of eight different measurement points on the end-effector (all offset from axis 6 by approximately 120 mm) are reduced from 0.968 mm / 2.158 mm respectively, to 0.364 mm / 0.696 mm.},

  abstract = {A novel 6D measurement system was recently proposed, comprising a single commercially available telescoping ballbar and two custom-made fixtures. One fixture is attached to the robot base and the other to the robot end-effector, and each having three magnetic cups. In each of 72 poses of the tool fixture, with respect to the base fixture, it is possible to measure six distances with the ballbar between the magnetic cups on the tool fixture and the magnetic cups on the base fixture, and thus calculate the pose with high accuracy. This paper is the first to present the successful use of this measurement system for absolute robot calibration. The robot calibrated is a Fanuc LR Mate 200iC six-axis industrial robot and the telescoping bar used is the QC20-W by Renishaw. The absolute position accuracy of the robot after calibration is validated with a Faro laser tracker in almost 10,000 robot configurations. Considering the validation data in only the front/up configurations, the mean absolute positioning error is improved from 0.873 mm to 0.479 mm. To allow a comparison, the robot is also calibrated using the laser tracker and the robot accuracy validated in the same 10,000 robot configurations.},

  abstract = {Doubly-curved ribbed concrete shells are a materially efficient means of spanning large areas such as roofs and floors. However, the fabrication of such structures poses challenges in terms of formwork manufacturing as well as material deposition. This has led to their decline compared to more prismatic shapes such as flat slabs which can be manufactured more economically. This paper presents a novel fabrication process called Automated Robotic Concrete Spraying (ARCS) by which glass fibre reinforced concrete (GFRC) is sprayed onto a curved formwork to create thin shell components of variable thickness. The trajectory planning and generation algorithm developed and implemented in ARCS to create such components is presented. Two sets of prototype shells were fabricated: one which forms the segments of a larger structural floor demonstrator and another consisting of a single component with deep ribs on a thin shell. The sequencing used to generate the spray paths for each component is outlined, with each prototype using two different strategies to add ribs onto the fabricated shells. While the fabrication process has been used in conjunction with a pin-bed mould actuating flexible formwork to create the spraying surface, the trajectory planning approach is adaptable enough such that any formwork can be utilised. Combined with the output speed of material deposition, ARCS offers the potential to enable mass production and customisation of doubly-curved ribbed structural concrete shells of variable thickness as an industrial process at an architectural scale.},

  abstract = {Robotic technology has become more present in Architecture, Engineering and Construction industry. Some architectural schools have integrated robotic education in their curriculum. In this paper, we question if we integrate these tools at an undergraduate level, will they understand the robotic fabrication technology?; and how does it affect their creativity? These questions have been explored during a 2-week workshop with 84 - 2nd-year architecture students, divided into 12 groups. Our research is experimental. The objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of using robotic fabrication in our architectural school, at the undergraduate level. We are particularly interested in robotic hotwire foam cutting because it is quick and cost-effective; it is an efficient technique to fabricate a prototype. The results were quantitatively evaluated using 3-point Likert scale based on: (1) the understanding of the concept of robotic fabrication. The student’s workpiece should be successfully imported into Sprutcam© software and generate robot toolpath for hotwire foam cutting, (2) the workpiece is suitable for fabrication with robot arm and is quick to produce, and (3) the workpiece can only be fabricated using robotic hotwire foam cutting. The result shows that most students (11 groups out of 12) understood the concept of robot arm with more or less efficiency in fabrication. Those who successfully fabricated using hotwire foam cutting technique designed the workpiece based on the principle of ruled surface. And this makes their work can exclusively be fabricated using robotic hotwire foam cutting technique. In conclusion, the use of robotic fabrication is deemed appropriate for the teaching of architecture in our school in the future.},

The outcome of the growth process is a digital surface in 3D space which has “grown” within and in response to its environment. We have developed a complementary Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) that is able to take over the task of generating the rewrite rules set for a growth process. Using a quantitative multi-objective fitness function that evaluates a variety surface properties, the integrated system (EA + Growth Process) can explore and generate diverse and interesting surfaces with a resemblance of organic form. The algorithms have been implemented to create a design tool for architects called Genr8.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces topology finding of patterns for shell structures such as beam grids for gridshells or voussoir tessellations for vaults, among others. The authors refer to topology finding, by analogy and in complement to form finding, as the design of the connectivity of these patterns in order to follow architectural, structural and construction requirements. This paper presents a computational approach relying on a specific design space and data structures based on singularity meshes, which encode the information about the singularities in patterns. The designed patterns are structured, i.e. with a low number of singularities, can include high-valency pole points, and respect alignment to surfaces, curves and points. A feature-based exploration approach is introduced with a generation procedure for singularity meshes following the boundaries of a surface as well as point and curve features, using a topological skeleton or medial axis. These features can stem from statics heuristics, whose efficiency is assessed in a case study. A rule-based editing approach for singularity meshes supplements featurebased topology finding, using a grammar of strip rules as parameters to further explore the singularity design space. This conceptual design approach and its algorithms are an aid for topological exploration of patterns for shell-like structures by architects and engineers.},

  abstract = {In recent years, many studies have focused on the mix-design and characterization of cementitious composites reinforced with plant fibres. It appears that in the fresh state, the morphology and the hydrophilic nature of these fibres significantly affect the rheology of the material. In the hardened state, the mechanical performances of the composites are lower than that of composites reinforced with standard fibres (glass, synthetic, etc.). These poor mechanical performances are mainly due to weak neo-formed fibre/matrix interface. Indeed, the high-water absorption capacity causes swelling/shrinkage of the fibre within the matrix, which subsequently generates an unbounded interface. In order to address these issues, numerous studies have been carried out over the past few years on compatibilisation treatments applied to plant fibres. In most cases, these are chemical treatments to leach the fibre, which often have a significant environmental impact. This work examines the influence of a coating treatment with linseed oil applied to flax fibres on the properties of cementitious composites. The first part of this study deals with the optimisation of this treatment. The second part focuses on the effect of this treatment on the properties of the composite in the fresh and hardened states. The results showed a noticeable improvement in the workability of the treated fibre composites. The linseed oil coating treatment can also significantly improve the flexural strength of the composite, depending on the mix-design. Flax fibres and linseed oil can also slightly enhance the thermal insulation properties of the material.},

Our library is based on hierarchical representations and designed to perform multiple proximity queries on different model representations. The set of queries includes discrete collision detection, continuous collision detection, separation distance computation and penetration depth estimation. The input models may correspond to triangulated rigid or deformable models and articulated models. Moreover, FCL can perform probabilistic collision checking between noisy point clouds that are captured using cameras or LIDAR sensors. The main benefit of FCL lies in the fact that it provides a unified interface that can be used by various applications. Furthermore, its flexible architecture makes it easier to implement new algorithms within this framework. The runtime performance of the library is comparable to state of the art collision and proximity algorithms.

From a conceptual point of view, industrial robot technology could provide an excellent base for machining being both flexible and cost efficient. However, industrial machining robots lack absolute positioning accuracy, are unable to reject/absorb disturbances in terms of process forces and lack reliable programming and simulation tools to ensure right first time machining, at production startups.

Operating with more than one (mechanical) arm allows for the exploitation of assembly processes by performing material manipulations on a shared fabrication task. The work presented here is an investigation of such cooperative robotic construction, wherein two industrial robots assemble a spatial metal structure consisting of discrete steel tubes. The developed construction method relies on the alternate positioning of building members into triangulated configurations, where one robot temporarily stabilises the assembly while the other places a tube and vice versa. The intricate geometric dependencies of this structural system, as well as the fact that the machines limit each other’s operational range, led to the exploration of robotic simulation and path planning strategies as an integral part of the design process. The experimental results of realising a space frame structure at an architectural scale (Fig. 2) validate this approach. COOPERATIVE FABRICATION OF SPATIAL METAL STRUCTURES},

  abstract = {Computer graphics, 3D computer vision and robotics communities have produced multiple approaches to representing 3D geometry for rendering and reconstruction. These provide trade-offs across fidelity, efficiency and compression capabilities. In this work, we introduce DeepSDF, a learned continuous Signed Distance Function (SDF) representation of a class of shapes that enables high quality shape representation, interpolation and completion from partial and noisy 3D input data. DeepSDF, like its classical counterpart, represents a shape’s surface by a continuous volumetric field: the magnitude of a point in the field represents the distance to the surface boundary and the sign indicates whether the region is inside (-) or outside (+) of the shape, hence our representation implicitly encodes a shape’s boundary as the zero-level-set of the learned function while explicitly representing the classification of space as being part of the shapes’ interior or not. While classical SDF’s both in analytical or discretized voxel form typically represent the surface of a single shape, DeepSDF can represent an entire class of shapes. Furthermore, we show stateof-the-art performance for learned 3D shape representation and completion while reducing the model size by an order of magnitude compared with previous work.},

  abstract = {Synthetic biology is an emerging scientific field that promotes the standardized manufacturing of biological components without natural equivalents. Its goal is to create artificial living systems that can meet various needs in health care or energy domains. While most works are focused on the individual bacterium as a chemical reactor, our project, SynBioTIC, addresses a novel and more complex challenge: shape engineering, i.e. the redesign of natural morphogenesis toward a new kind of "developmental 3D printing". Potential applications include organ growth, natural computing in biocircuits, or future vegetal houses. To create in silico multicellular organisms that exhibit specific shapes, we construe their development as an iterative process combining fundamental collective phenomena such as homeostasis, patterning, segmentation, and limb growth. Our numerical experiments rely on the existing Escherichia coli simulator Gro, a physico-chemical computation platform offering reaction-diffusion and collision dynamics solvers. The synthetic "bioware" of our model executes a set of rules, or "genome", in each cell. Cells can differentiate into several predefined types associated with specific actions (divide, emit signal, detect signal, die). Transitions between types are triggered by conditions involving internal and external sensors that detect various protein levels inside and around the cell. Indirect communication between bacteria is relayed by morphogen diffusion and the mechanical constraints of 2D packing. Starting from a single bacterium, the overall architecture emerges in a purely endogenous fashion through a series of developmental stages, inlcuding proliferation, differentiation, morphogen diffusion and synchronization. The genome can be parametrized to control the growth and features of appendages individually. As exemplified by the L and T shapes that we obtain, certain precursor cells can be inhibited while others can create limbs of varying size ("divergence of the homology"). Such morphogenetic phenotypes open the way to more complex shapes made of a recursive array of core bodies and limbs and, most importantly, to an evolutionary developmental ("evo-devo") exploration of unplanned functional forms.},

Such technology has already gained essential industrial acceptance, but its application for small lot production is limited by the tedious and time-consuming process of robot programming. Currently, even sophisticated graphical simulation systems do not allow optimization of robot motion using multiple criteria, nor does it take into account redundancy caused by the tool axial symmetry. The particular contribution of this paper lies in the area of multiobjective optimization of robot motions via graph representation of the search space and dynamic programming procedures. It presents algorithms that allow generation of smooth manipulator trajectories within acceptable time, simultaneously considering kinematics, collision and singularities constraints of the robotic system, as well as the limitations of the robot control units. The efficiency of the algorithms has been carefully investigated via computer simulation. The presented results are implemented in a commercial software package and verified for real-life applications in the automotive industry.},

  abstract = {Buildings account for 40\% of total global energy consumption. The International Energy Agency (IEA) and the European Commission (EC) are attempting to achieve an 80\% reduction in global emissions by 2050. The objectives of this paper are to identify the refurbishment scenario with the lowest environmental impact using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and to assess the scenario’s robustness to future climate change scenarios using a sensitivity analysis. We applied and verified the proposed approach in a residential case study of a reference project located in Kapfernberg, Austria. The environmental assessment included two façade refurbishment proposals (minimum and high quality with respect to energy), onsite energy generation (using solar thermal collectors and photovoltaic (PV) panels), one renewable future energy mix and the effects of climate change according to the Austrian Panel on Climate Change (APCC). The environmental indicators used in the assessment were the cumulative energy demand non-renewable (CED n. ren.), global warming potential (GWP) and ecological scarcity (UBP) over building life cycles. The results indicated that a high-quality refurbishment of the thermal envelope with prefabricated façade elements, including solar thermal collectors and PV panels, represented the optimal refurbishment. In terms of the environmental indicators, the high-quality refurbishment scenario is always beneficial throughout the building’s life cycle. Additionally, the sensitivity analysis of the high-quality refurbishment scenario found an increasing production of surplus electricity with increasing PV area. This surplus of energy provides greater benefit in the short term with the current energy mix. Once the energy from the grid is shifted to renewable sources, the added benefit is decreased. Therefore, it is necessary to find an optimal balance between diminishing returns due to changes in the future energy mix and the financial investment made over the lifetime of the building, especially for plus energy buildings. However the findings from this specific case study need to be evaluated for other refurbishment cases, taking into account future local climate change and energy supply mix scenarios in other regions.},

  abstract = {The global construction industry is one the least productive sectors over a 30-year period, which arguably could be related to virtually no implementation of digital and automation technologies within the construction industry. Construction processes arguably consist of expensive manual labor or manual operation of mechanized processes, where hand-drawn markings on work-objects or partly build structures are used to inform and steer the construction process or allows for ad hoc adjustments of elements. As such, the use of on-object, hand-drawn information is considered integral to the modus operandi of a plurality of construction trades, where timber construction and carpentry are of special interest. In contrast, emerging methods of digital production in timber construction implicitly or explicitly seek to eliminate the interpretive component to the construction work, imposing a top-down paradigm of file-to-factory execution. While such systems offer a performance increase compared to manual labor, it is notoriously sensitive to construction tolerances and requires a high level of specialism to be operated, which could alienate craft-educated workers. This research argues that developing methods for digital production compatible with on-site human interpretation and adaptation can help overcome these challenges. In addition, these methods offer the opportunity to increase the robustness and versatility of digital fabrication in the context of the construction site. The article reports on a new method titled “augmented drawn construction symbols” that through a visual communication system converts on-object hand-drawn markings to CAD drawings and sends them to a robotic system. The process is demonstrated on a full-scale prototypical robot setup.},

  abstract = {Reinforcement learning offers a promising methodology for developing skills for simulated characters, but typically requires working with sparse hand-crafted features. Building on recent progress in deep reinforcement learning (DeepRL), we introduce a mixture of actor-critic experts (MACE) approach that learns terrainadaptive dynamic locomotion skills using high-dimensional state and terrain descriptions as input, and parameterized leaps or steps as output actions.

Additional elements of our solution that contribute towards efficient learning include Boltzmann exploration and the use of initial actor biases to encourage specialization.

The first essay presented in this chapter, by Stephen Perrella, is a précis of end-of-millennium design theory: the Objectile is an open-ended notation which allows for infinite parametric variations; these can be directly fabricated using file-to-factory technologies, thus enabling the serial reproduction of non-identical parts, where ranges of limited variations can be mass-produced at no extra cost. Perrella noted that Cache's model of openness and indeterminacy in digital design notation could theoretically put design in the hands of the end-user. The second essay by Cache highlights that Objectile's aim is to develop procedures, both software and hardware, that will make digital architecture a reality at an affordable cost for small architectural practices and the average consumer.},

Abstract Due to its low environmental impact, earth construction has received much consideration in recent years. Nevertheless, its development remains limited due to low production rate. Recent developments have been made to improve earth-based materials mix-design and processing methods. Simultaneously, digitally based construction methods have been introduced in the field of construction especially for cement-based materials application. Among these new techniques, the so-called 3D printing by extrusion deposit has been the most intensively studied. In this study, we assess the possibility of adapting this technique to earth-based material. After making the earth’s rheological behaviour suitable for 3D printing, a laboratory-scale printing has been carried out and the printed samples have been mechanically tested.},

  abstract = {Abstract Earth-based mortars are commonly reinforced with bio-based materials such as straw or biopolymers. The aim of this work is to identify reinforcements that are able to improve the mechanical strengths and the ductility of an earth-based matrix. We have also attempted to describe the mechanisms of reinforcement involved in such materials. Firstly, a kaolinite-based clay soil was mixed with sand to achieve earth-based mortars with the highest density at the dry state. For this material (kaolinite-based mortar), we have shown that, at the same water content, the compressive strength at the dry state only depends on the dry density of the sample whatever the forming process. Various quantities of fibers, fabrics and alginate were then used to reinforce the studied mortars (a kaolinite based mortar and a natural soil containing swelling clay sieved at 4 mm). We found that these reinforcements significantly increase the compressive strength of all tested samples containing kaolinite. A comparison between the two materials helps us to understand the reinforcement mechanisms for various fibers; it also demonstrates that natural fibers and woven fabrics enhance the mechanical behavior of earth mortars notably under a compressive load.},

  abstract = {The environmental performance of hemp based natural fiber mat thermoplastic (NMT) has been evaluated in this study by quantifying carbon storage potential and CO2 emissions and comparing the results with commercially available glass fiber composites. Non-woven mats of hemp fiber and polypropylene matrix were used to make NMT samples by film-stacking method without using any binder aid. The results showed that hemp based NMT have compatible or even better strength properties as compared to conventional flax based thermoplastics. A value of 63 MPa for flexural strength is achieved at 64\% fiber content by weight. Similarly, impact energy values (84–154 J/m) are also promising. The carbon sequestration and storage by hemp crop through photosynthesis is estimated by quantifying dry biomass of fibers based on one metric ton of NMT. A value of 325 kg carbon per metric ton of hemp based composite is estimated which can be stored by the product during its useful life. An extra 22\% carbon storage can be achieved by increasing the compression ratio by 13\% while maintaining same flexural strength. Further, net carbon sequestration by industrial hemp crop is estimated as 0.67 ton/h/year, which is compatible to all USA urban trees and very close to naturally, regenerated forests. A comparative life cycle analysis focused on non-renewable energy consumption of natural and glass fiber composites shows that a net saving of 50\hphantom{,}000 MJ (∼3 ton CO2 emissions) per ton of thermoplastic can be achieved by replacing 30\% glass fiber reinforcement with 65\% hemp fiber. It is further estimated that 3.07 million ton CO2 emissions (4.3\% of total USA industrial emissions) and 1.19 million m3 crude oil (1.0\% of total Canadian oil consumption) can be saved by substituting 50\% fiber glass plastics with natural fiber composites in North American auto applications. However, to compete with glass fiber effectively, further research is needed to improve natural fiber processing, interfacial bonding and control moisture sensitivity in longer run.},

To extend the time during which those types of cement remain workable, retarding admixtures can be used. However, retarders may affect the amounts and types of hydration products formed and as a consequence the ability of hydrated cement to chemically bind water. This work investigates the influence of two natural-based admixtures on the self-desiccation ability of a vernacular CSA ternary binder used as earth stabilization. Vicat measurements were used to study the efficiency of citric acid and sucrose as retarding admixtures on the setting time of stabilized earth. A quantitative study of the self-desiccation ability of the binder was performed on dried binder pastes using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Results show that both admixtures have a significant impact on the setting time of the binder. Furthermore, TGA showed that the self-desiccation ability of this vernacular CSA binder is significantly reduced when citric acid at high dosages is used, both at early hydration and after 14 days. On the contrary, the use of sucrose does not affect the water chemically bound at an early age but can maximize bound water after 14 days of hydration.},

This new-found flexibility results from the fact that no formwork is required with additive manufacturing and thus each part can be different at no additional cost. One drawback however is that the geometric freedom comes at the price of non-verified geometric precision, requiring methods to determine and possibly counteract deviations and ensure building component's quality. Within this paper we present an "Lean-based Production Approach" for an off-site production of concrete components. Therefore, firstly lean construction is introduced and its synergies with additive manufacturing are shown. Shotcrete 3D Printing is used as a case study and illustrates the approach and unveils current potentials and challenges. Our approach is mainly based on an on demand production, bi-directional digital workflows and quality checks. Current methods for geometric and surface quality as well as for predicting production (and process) times for varying components still need to be developed further. We conclude with forecasting a new and more intelligent production system in construction.},

  abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to characterize and evaluate a new 3D-printing process based on Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). Design/methodology/approach – A benchmark part and standard parts were designed, printed by a 3D-printer and characterized. Findings – 3D printed PMMA parts have a tensile strength of 2.91 MPa and a modulus of elasticity of 223 MPa. The mechanical properties can be improved by infiltrations with epoxy (tensile strength: 26.6 MPa, modulus of elasticity: 1,190 MPa). The surface quality of the parts can be improved by infiltration with wax for usage as lost models. The minimum feature size is 0.3 mm.},

  abstract = {A novel formwork system is presented as a material saving, labour reducing and cost-effective solution for the casting of bespoke doubly curved concrete geometries. The approach uses a custom knit technical textile as a lightweight stay-in-place formwork with integrated solutions for the insertion of additional elements, and is fabricated as a nearly seamless fabric. Using weft knitting as the textile formation technique minimises the need for cutting patterns, sewing, welding or gluing, when compared to conventional weaving and gives the possibility to integrate channels, openings, have varying widths and directional material properties, thus broadening the geometric design space. The system has been tested through a small-scale concrete footbridge prototype, built using a pre-stressed hybrid knitted textile and a bending-active structure that acted as a waste-free, stay-inplace, self-supporting formwork. Through the gradual buildup of strength in thin layers of concrete, formwork deformations during casting were minimised. This allowed for low tensioning levels of the fabric and the possibility to use higher pressure (e.g. during shotcreting) in applying the subsequent concrete without intermediate support from below. The computational design and fabrication of the knitted textile formwork included integrated channels for the insertion of bending-active rods, tensioning ribbons and features for controlling the concrete casting. The analysis and process of increasing the stiffness of the lightweight and flexible formwork is presented. The hybrid approach results in an ultra-lightweight formwork that is easily transportable and significantly reduces the need for falsework support and scaffolding, which has many advantages on the construction site.},

Why do digitally produced surfaces often imitate existing materials, rather than offering new innovative alternatives?

It shows how the emancipatory force of genuinely open, free, and competitive markets can reawaken the dormant nineteenth-century spirit of liberal reform and lead to greater equality, prosperity, and cooperation. Only by radically expanding the scope of markets can we reduce inequality, restore robust economic growth, and resolve political conflicts.

It turns out that this property makes patterns of geodesics the basic geometric entity when dealing with the cladding of a freeform surface with wooden panels which do not bend sideways. Likewise a geodesic is the favored shape of timber support elements in freeform architecture, for reasons of manufacturing and statics. Both problem areas are fundamental in freeform architecture, but so far only experimental solutions have been available. This paper provides a systematic treatment and shows how to design geodesic patterns in different ways: The evolution of geodesic curves is good for local studies and simple patterns; the level set formulation can deal with the global layout of multiple patterns of geodesics; finally geodesic vector fields allow us to interactively model geodesic patterns and perform surface segmentation into panelizable parts.},

Moreover, we describe a ‘feature sensitive’ metric on surfaces, whose definition relies on the concept of an image manifold, introduced into Computer Vision and Image Processing by Kimmel, Malladi and Sochen. This metric is sensitive to features such as smoothed edges, which are characterized by a significant deviation of the two principal curvatures. We illustrate its applications at hand of feature sensitive curve design on surfaces and local neighborhood definition and region growing as an aid in the segmentation process for reverse engineering of geometric objects.},

  abstract = {The nature of creative engagement with computers and software presents a number of challenges to 4E cognition and requires the development of analytical frameworks that can encompass cognitive processes as they extend across material and informational realms. Here I argue that an enactive view of mind allows for better understanding of digital practice by advancing a dynamic, transactional, and affective framework for the analysis of computational design. This enactive framework is in part developed through the Material Engagement Theory (MET) put forward by Lambros Malafouris, in part from the phenomenologically inspired philosophy of Bernard Stiegler. Both advance temporality, technics and technique as key to understanding human creative imagination and their work can support each other in different ways; Stiegler allows for a theorisation of digital tools largely missing from the cognitive archaeology of Malafouris, whilst Malafouris provides a cognitive theory to further develop key ideas in Stiegler’s philosophy. Bringing their work together through Gilbert Simondon’s theory of individuation, I develop the concept of enactive individuation and apply this to the analysis of a case of robotic design and fabrication from my fieldwork with digital architects and engineers. This case allows for further exploration of how enactivism might productively be extended into the digital realm by underscoring the explorative engagement at heart of even highly systematic work with computers and software.},

The mix proportions of the variables were varied to assess optimum dosages for producing geopolymer stabilised compressed earth bricks. The results showed that the natural clay minerals in the soil do not yield sufficient strength. Use of ground slag and fly ash as an additional source of alumina and silica resulted in sufficient strength gain for the compressed earth specimen. The geopolymer stabilised compressed earth specimens showed efflorescence due to leaching of salts and the investigations showed that the efflorescence does not affect the strength.

The particular property of cables provides CDPRs several advantages, including larger workspaces, higher payload-to-weight ratio and lower manufacturing costs rather than rigid-link robots. In this paper, the history of the development of CDPRs is introduced and several successful latest application cases of CDPRs are presented. The theory development of CDPRs is introduced focusing on design, performance analysis and control theory. Research on CDPRs gains wide attention and is highly motivated by the modern engineering demand for large load capacity and workspace. A number of exciting advances in CDPRs are summarized in this paper since it is proposed in the 1980s, which points to a fruitful future both in theory and application. In order to meet the increasing requirements of robot in different areas, future steps foresee more in-depth research and extension applications of CDPRs including intelligent control, composite materials, integrated and reconfigurable design.},

  abstract = {Computing discrete geodesic distance over triangle meshes is one of the fundamental problems in computational geometry and computer graphics. In this problem, an effective window pruning strategy can significantly affect the actual running time. Due to its importance, we conduct an in-depth study of window pruning operations in this paper, and produce an exhaustive list of scenarios where one window can make another window partially or completely redundant. To identify a maximal number of redundant windows using such pairwise cross checking, we propose a set of procedures to synchronize local window propagation within the same triangle by simultaneously propagating a collection of windows from one triangle edge to its two opposite edges. On the basis of such synchronized window propagation, we design a new geodesic computation algorithm based on a triangle-oriented region growing scheme. Our geodesic algorithm can remove most of the redundant windows at the earliest possible stage, thus significantly reducing computational cost and memory usage at later stages. In addition, by adopting triangles instead of windows as the primitive in propagation management, our algorithm significantly cuts down the data management overhead. As a result, it runs 4-15 times faster than MMP and ICH algorithms, 2-4 times faster than FWP-MMP and FWP-CH algorithms, and also incurs the least memory usage.},

  abstract = {Fast and efficient motion planning algorithms are crucial for many state-of-the-art robotics applications such as self-driving cars. Existing motion planning methods such as RRT*, A*, and D*, become ineffective as their computational complexity increases exponentially with the dimensionality of the motion planning problem. To address this issue, we present a neural network-based novel planning algorithm which generates endto-end collision-free paths irrespective of the obstacles’ geometry. The proposed method, called MPNet (Motion Planning Network), comprises of a Contractive Autoencoder which encodes the given workspaces directly from a point cloud measurement, and a deep feedforward neural network which takes the workspace encoding, start and goal configuration, and generates end-to-end feasible motion trajectories for the robot to follow. We evaluate MPNet on multiple planning problems such as planning of a pointmass robot, rigid-body, and 7 DOF Baxter robot manipulators in various 2D and 3D environments. The results show that MPNet is not only consistently computationally efficient in all 2D and 3D environments but also show remarkable generalization to completely unseen environments. The results also show that computation time of MPNet consistently remains less than 1 second which is significantly lower than existing state-of-theart motion planning algorithms. Furthermore, through transfer learning, the MPNet trained in one scenario (e.g., indoor living places) can also quickly adapt to new scenarios (e.g., factory floors) with a little amount of data.},

  abstract = {This paper describes Motion Planning Networks (MPNet)1, a computationally efficient, learning-based neural planner for solving motion planning problems. MPNet uses neural networks to learn general near-optimal heuristics for path planning in seen and unseen environments. It takes environment information such as raw point-cloud from depth sensors, as well as a robot’s initial and desired goal configurations and recursively calls itself to bidirectionally generate connectable paths. In addition to finding directly connectable and near-optimal paths in a single pass, we show that worst-case theoretical guarantees can be proven if we merge this neural network strategy with classical sample-based planners in a hybrid approach while still retaining significant computational and optimality improvements. To train the MPNet models, we present an active continual learning approach that enables MPNet to learn from streaming data and actively ask for expert demonstrations when needed, drastically reducing data for training. We validate MPNet against goldstandard and state-of-the-art planning methods in a variety of problems from 2D to 7D robot configuration spaces in challenging and cluttered environments, with results showing significant and consistently stronger performance metrics, and motivating neural planning in general as a modern strategy for solving motion planning problems efficiently.},

It means a leading out. [E]ducation is a leading out of what is already there in the pupil’s soul’.2 After a call to debunk stereotypes, I will turn to concrete evidence of the affordance theory in practice through meta-modelling in the third and last part entitled ‘Two Compasses, One World’. In the words of Reza Negarestani: ‘Conception without praxis is unrealised abstraction and praxis without conception is a hollow impression of concreteness’.3},

The project is developed for labour-intensive construction to enable poverty relief and skills transfer into the surrounding area. Form-finding based on equilibrium thrust line analysis allows the design of thin unreinforced masonry shells that act in pure compression. Digital models let us translate advanced geometry into simple guides for construction. Traditional tile vaulting, using locallymade, pressed soil-cement tiles, allows the complex shapes to be built by newly trained workers without extensive formwork. A hands-on programme of design and construction suggests a new way to jointly manage architecture and development programs. This merging of novel structural geometry with traditional materials and craft has resulted in a new interpretation centre for a trans-frontier national park in South Africa.},

The real-world dynamics tend to be very painful even for executing simple algorithms like a Wavefront planner or A-star search. This paper addresses designing techniques that tend to be robust as well as reusable for any hardware platforms; covering problems like controlling asynchronous drives, odometry offset issues and handling abnormal sensory feedback. The algorithm implementation medium and hardware design tools have been kept general in order to present our work as a serving platform for future researchers and robotics enthusiast working in the field of path planning robotics.},

Sustainability could be achieved by using environment friendly materials and structural systems in construction industry. This paper aimed to study using geopolymer concrete as a structural board in constructing insulation sandwich panels under different types of loading. Four compression tests were performed on wall specimens in order to study the behavior of the panels under vertical in plane forces. Axial capacity prediction of wall panels was discussed using four published design equations. Eight one-way slab sandwich panels specimens were tested under flexure loading with different shear span ratios in order to compare the flexural behavior of conventional concrete and geopolymer concrete sandwich panels. The capacities of the slab panels were estimated using the conventional concrete codes provisions and compared to the experimental values. Geopolymer sandwich panels approved its ability to sustain different type of loading in the same manner as that of conventional concrete. A prototype was constructed to assess the constructability and the construction cost of the proposed system. The lack of production lines of geopolymer ingredients increases the material cost. On the other hand, the calculated total cost for different construction systems revealed that the labor cost is lower for the cast in place structural insulated panels CIP-SIP system.},

  abstract = {The phase change of water from liquid to vapor is one of the most energy-intensive physical processes in nature, giving it immense potential for cooling. Diverse evaporative cooling strategies have resulted worldwide, including roof ponds and sprinklers, courtyard fountains, wind catchers with qanats, irrigated green roofs, and fan-assisted evaporative coolers. These methods all require water in bulk liquid form. The evaporation of moisture that has been sorbed from the atmosphere by hygroscopic materials is equally energy-intensive, however, yet has not been examined for its cooling potential. In arid and semi-arid climates, hygroscopic earth buildings occur widely and are known to maintain comfortable indoor temperatures, but evaporation of moisture from their walls and roofs has been regarded as unimportant since water scarcity limits irrigation and rainfall; instead, their cool interiors are attributed to well-established mass effects in delaying the transmission of sensible gains. Here, we investigate the cooling accomplished by daily cycles of moisture sorption and evaporation which, requiring only ambient humidity, we designate as “intrinsic” evaporative cooling. Connecting recent soil science to heat and moisture transport studies in building materials, we use soils, adobe, cob, unfired earth bricks, rammed earth, and limestone to reveal the effects of numerous parameters (temperature and relative humidity, material orientation, thickness, moisture retention properties, vapor diffusion resistance, and liquid transport properties) on the magnitude of intrinsic evaporative cooling and the stabilization of indoor relative humidity. We further synthesize these effects into concrete design guidance. Together, these results show that earth buildings in diverse climates have significant potential to cool themselves evaporatively through sorption of moisture from humid night air and evaporation during the following day’s heat. This finding challenges the perception of limited evaporative cooling resources in arid climates and greatly expands the applicability of evaporative cooling in contemporary buildings to water-stressed regions.},

Whereas digital design and fabrication are technical notions, automation immediately has societal and political repercussions. Automation relates to industrialization and mechanisation—allowing to historically reconnect the digital while bypassing the post-modern, deconstructivist, or parametric decades. Using a series of built prototypes making use of timber, this paper will describe how the combined technologies of automation and discreteness enable both technical efficiencies and new architectural interest. Both projects are based on timber sheet materials, cut and folded into larger elements that are then assembled into functional structures. Both projects are also fragments of larger housing blocks. Discrete building blocks are presented from a technical perspective as occupying a space in between programmable matter and modular prefabrication. Timber is identified as an ideal material for automated discrete construction. From an architectural perspective, the paper discusses the implications of an architecture based on parts that remain autonomous from the whole.},

We use Gaussian Mixture Regression to extract a parameterization with relevant non-linear features from a set of demonstrations of a motion following the paradigm of learning from demonstration. The resulting parameterization takes the form of a non-linear time-invariant dynamical system (DS). We use this time-invariant DS as a parameterized policy for a variant of the PI² policy search algorithm. This paper contributes by adapting PI² for our time-invariant motion representation. We introduce two novel parameter exploration schemes that can be used to (1) sample model parameters to achieve a uniform exploration in state space and (2) explore while ensuring stability of the resulting motion model. Additionally, a state dependent stiffness profile is learned simultaneously to the reference trajectory and both are used together in a variable impedance control architecture. This learning architecture is validated in a hardware experiment consisting of a digging task using a KUKA LWR platform.},

The implicitly regulated phenotypes suggest advances for the automatic design of physical structures, by improving scalability of the genotype encoding and embedding real-world constraints. We demonstrate that our model can evolve novel, yet efficient, architectural structures which exhibit emergent shape, topology and material distribution. Finally, we compare evolved structures against a “hand-coded” solution to illustrate that our model produces competitive results without prior knowledge of the design solution or direct human guidance.},

Often, the novelty of these evolved designs is due to their ability to discover and exploit important principles of the design space, such as the truss and the ratchet. One current obstacle to the realworld application of such EDSs is that they often create purely descriptive representations, and are therefore capable of generating designs whose specific assembly is difficult, if not impossible, to infer. One solution that we offer is to evolve how to build, rather than what to build. When evolution occurs in assembly space rather than design space, only buildable objects are produced. Furthermore, as we demonstrate in this paper, doing so allows for the emergence not just of novel designs, but of novel means of assembly.},

Buildings are subject to fundamental and immutable laws that impose shapes, patterns, orders and constraints. The Bones of Architecture examines the cultivation of structures at the service of architecture. Seven European architects and engineers present their works and individual approaches, reflecting upon rules, strategies and methods in structural design. Three projects have been chosen for each of them to both demonstrate and explore various design strategies. This panorama is supplemented by interviews with the three representatives - Rui Furtado (Porto), Bruther (Paris) and Brandlhuber+ (Berlin) - and essays from Ákos Moravánszky and Mario Rinke.},

  abstract = {Contemporary innovations in structural form-finding and fabrication techniques are leading to design of freeform masonry architecture. These new forms create new challenges in laying out tessellation patterns, especially if structural, fabrication and construction requirements as well as aesthetical considerations are taken into account. Addressing these challenges, we review historic stone-cutting strategies and their geometric principles, forming the base for the development of two new discretisation approaches for given thrust surfaces, allowing for various degrees of user control. First, we introduce a tessellation approach based on primal, anisotropic triangular meshes and their dual counterparts. Second, an alternative tessellation approach based on transverse cutting curves is presented. Using a simple set of geometric rules, both methods enable the design of rigid, staggered bonds with locally force-flow aligned block configurations to avoid sliding failures. For this research, the tessellation design of the Armadillo Vault, an unreinforced, dryassembled, cut-stone stone shell, served as a case study to demonstrate the feasibility of our methods in the context of a full-scale architectural project.},

Using industrial 3D printing with silica sand, the presented system enables significant weight reduction of up to 70\% when compared to conventional concrete floor slabs, by placing the 3D printed material in key structural areas and by externalising tension forces. The form-finding process for the global shape of the floors and the generation of structurally optimised print mesh geometries are presented. Three floor prototypes with varying rib geometries and discretisation layouts were studied. The results from the serviceability and ultimate load testing of the floors are documented in detail. The data showed that this relatively weak material can be used, without internal reinforcement, to print a floor that is able to support loads in excess of typical design code levels.},

Through the combination of the recently developed form finding methods like Thrust Network Analysis (TNA), which facilitates the design of freeform compression-only surfaces and fast and flexible CNC-machining, structural efficient and expressive stone structures could be build which embrace today’s technological, economical, and ecological demands. This can only happen when all constraints in the process of design and materialization are fully understood and integrated in a smooth digital stream from form finding to fabrication. This paper focuses on the geometrical interdependencies between the generation of the voussoirs and the physical limitations of the fabrication on the basis of structural information. The principle is tested physically by cutting individual foam blocks, simulating the rapid and efficient cutting of natural stone with a diamondwire saw. This is done on an experimental fabrication setup, especially designed for this research and based on four-axes CNC hot-wire cutting technology.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a new typology of structurally efficient, funnel-shaped shells for light and open architectural applications. We discuss a novel approach for structural form finding of funicular shell shapes by defining free boundaries that are balanced by continuous tension rings. Existing funnel-shaped structures illustrate the compelling possibilities for design variation in which vertical and horizontal structural elements transition smoothly, creating exciting spatial configurations. Initially delicate designs are often executed using bulky cantilevers though, which derogate the true elegance of these shapes. The new techniques discussed in this paper demonstrate how the combination of compression-only shells with funicular tension rings leads to a great variety of efficient and expressive forms. The research demonstrates how compression and tension forces can be explicitly controlled and manipulated locally in such structures, using a fully implemented, digital form-finding tool based on Thrust Network Analysis. Thanks to the flexible implementation, resulting shell designs range from simple symmetric shapes to complex, configurations with perforations in the shell and undulating ridge edges. Independent of their complexity, all resulting shells are subject to the clear and comprehensible structural system. The structural system is tested and verified using a 3D-printed, discrete, structural scale model. The elegance and delicate composition of form and force in compression and tension showcased in this funnel-shaped rib-vaulted model hints to the new possibilities for contemporary, architectural applications of the presented structural typology.},

Fast and robust solving algorithms enable the interactive exploration of these constrained structural systems. By giving explicit, bidirectional control over the internal force distribution and overall geometry to the designer, free exploration of these statically highly indeterminate systems is made possible. The equilibrium of funicular compression networks is represented by reciprocal diagrams, which visually express the force dependencies between different parts of the structure. By modifying these diagrams in real-time, the designer is able to explore novel and expressive vaulted geometries that are blurring the difference between shapes associated to typical compression-only forms, obtained e.g. with hanging networks, and freeform surface structures. The power of this framework for design is demonstrated by a user-friendly software implementation, which has been used to design and build a freeform, thin-tile masonry vault.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a method for grasp planning and object manipulation that enables the world’s first autonomous assembly of a large-scale stone wall with an unmanned hydraulic excavator system. Our method utilizes point clouds and mesh surface reconstruction of stones in order to plan grasp configurations with a 2-jaw gripper mounted on the excavator. Besides considering the geometry of the stone to sample force closure grasps, the grasp planner also takes into account collision constraints during object pick and place, informed by a LiDAR based point cloud map. Furthermore, we show an approach to reorient arbitrarily shaped objects that are not feasible to be directly placed at the desired location without violating collision constraints. Using a physics engine, we find a settled intermediate pose that allows direct placement and is reachable from the initial stone pose. The applicability of the proposed grasp planning method is demonstrated with the construction of a dry stone wall composed of over one hundred boulders using an autonomous excavator. We show a high primary grasp success rate (82.2 \%) and illustrate how the system recovers from slippage by relocating the object and re- planning the grasp correspondingly.

  abstract = {Buildings are major sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and contributors to the climate crisis. To meet climate-change mitigation needs, one must go beyond operational energy consumption and related GHG emissions of buildings and address their full life cycle. This study investigates the global trends of GHG emissions arising across the life cycle of buildings by systematically compiling and analysing more than 650 life cycle assessment (LCA) case studies. The results, presented for different energy performance classes based on a final sample of 238 cases, show a clear reduction trend in life cycle GHG emissions due to improved operational energy performance. However, the analysis reveals an increase in relative and absolute contributions of so‐called ‘embodied’ GHG emissions, i.e., emissions arising from manufacturing and processing of building materials. While the average share of embodied GHG emissions from buildings following current energy performance regulations is approximately 20–25\% of life cycle GHG emissions, this figure escalates to 45–50\% for highly energy-efficient buildings and surpasses 90\% in extreme cases. Furthermore, this study analyses GHG emissions at time of occurrence, highlighting the ‘carbon spike’ from building production. Relating the results to existing benchmarks for buildings’ GHG emissions in the Swiss SIA energy efficiency path shows that most cases exceed the target of 11.0 kgCO2eq/m2a. Considering global GHG reduction targets, these results emphasize the urgent need to reduce GHG emissions of buildings by optimizing both operational and embodied impacts. The analysis further confirmed a need for improving transparency and comparability of LCA studies.},

The mobile manipulator consists of a mobile platform driven by Mecanum wheels and a robotic arm with 6 degrees of freedom. A Mecanum wheeled platform provides 3 degrees of freedom in motion. Such a platform is usually driven by 4 or more Mecanum wheels, which are mounted in a fixed position at the platform. If a mobile platform is driven by more than 3 wheels, it builds an over-actuated and oversensed driving system. The paper develops a compact and easy applicable kinematic model of over-actuated Mecanum wheeled mobile platforms that includes the kinematic motion constraints of the system. The kinematic model is described by a single Jacobi matrix, which is invertible and therefore can be used in the forward and inverse kinematic model. Furthermore the paper describes the overall controller structure for our mobile manipulator OmnMan including the real-time synchronization of platform and manipulator. The motion controller of the platform includes a coupling controller that controls the kinematic motion constraints. Experimental results evaluates the effectiveness of the coupling controller.},

In the first section, we introduce Erwin Panofsky’s three levels of interpretation of an artwork, and we propose to import this approach in the field of philosophy of technology. Second, the rest of the article focuses on the third level, with a specific attention towards big data and algorithms of artificial intelligence. The thesis is that these new technologies are not only radically transforming our interactions with the world, or our modes of production and consumption, but also our worldview. In the second section, we rely on Panofsky’s Gothic Architecture and Scholasticism to describe the Scholastic “mental habit” or worldview and its principles. In the third section, we confront this worldview with the mechanistic and informationistic worldviews. Our contribution consists in arguing that (1) despite the differences, the Scholastic, mechanistic, and informationistic worldviews are part of the same logical and causal order that dominated Western epistemology, and (2) today we are facing the appearance of a new worldview that we call “data worldview”. Examples from design, architecture, and visualization of knowledge will be set all along the article.},

  abstract = {Purpose – To review presentations on robotics in “less familiar environments” given at a seminar, “The changing face of robotics: inside and outside the factory”, organised by the UK Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE). Design/methodology/approach – This paper covers the second part of the IEE seminar, which was concerned with robotics outside the traditional areas of “metal bashing”. Four diverse industries are covered: food, defence, construction and space. The presentation on “food”, by Bob Lloyd of AMTRI puts forward the concept of “a food factory in a pipe”, while that by Andy Cooke from BAE Systems, on “defence” describes R\&D projects ranging from a crawler robot for wing skin drilling to a volcano-exploring mobile robot. The “construction industry” presentation by John Riehl of Construction Robotics introduces START (safety through automated and robotic technologies), an organisation dedicated to improving safety in the industry by exploiting existing robotic technologies to remove operators from dangerous environments. The final presentation on “space robotics” by Dr Eddie Moxie of Surrey University, discusses “On-Orbit Servicing” in which robotic arms handle satellites and their componentary, and the development of rover or mobile robot vehicles in “Planetary Exploration”.},

  abstract = {The traditional process of making precast concrete molds requires significant manual labor. The molds are made using hardwood, cost tens of thousands of dollars, and take weeks to build. Once built, a mold will last 5-10 pulls before becoming too heavily degraded to continue use. With additive manufacturing, the same mold can be built in eight hours, post-machined in eight hours, costs about \$9000, and is projected to last nearly 200 pulls. Oak Ridge National Laboratory has been working with Big Area Additive Manufacturing (BAAM) to fabricate concrete molds for a new high-rise apartment complex in New York. The molded pieces will form structural window supports for the hundreds of windows in building façade. The magnitude of window molds is where additive manufacturing can shine when producing the geometry. This paper will discuss the methods and findings of using BAAM to replace conventional precast concrete pattern making.},

Although ubiquitous in our everyday surroundings, modeling them using existing tools requires significant geometric expertise and time. Our paper simplifies the modeling process by introducing an intuitive sketch-based approach for modeling developables. We develop an algorithm that given an arbitrary, user specified 3D polyline boundary, constructed using a sketching interface, generates a smooth discrete developable surface that interpolates this boundary. Our method utilizes the connection between developable surfaces and the convex hulls of their boundaries. The method explores the space of possible interpolating surfaces searching for a developable surface with desirable shape characteristics such as fairness and predictability. The algorithm is not restricted to any particular subset of developable surfaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a series of examples, from architectural design to garments.},

  abstract = {Robotics in Architecture is a widely established research field with various notable scholarly contributions. Historically automobile manufactures have established the production and use of robot arms and have consequently had the most impact on the design of robot arms with their demands in mind. Thus one could argument that most robot arms were and are developed for an industry where the product comes to the tool in a fixed site. When translating this mode of production ‘product – tool – site’ to an architectural context one has to admit that the mode of production differs (site varies – tool needs to come to site – product is result of site-specific design enabled by tools). This paper is a position paper that questions if robot arms designed and developed for a different mode of production are the right tools for pursuing digital fabrication in constructing and building architecture. By introducing collaborative robotics the paper discusses and outlines the advantages as well as disadvantages of collaborative robotics systems. It concludes with recent findings in creative and collaborative robotics that could shift the use of industry robots in architecture as a research tool to collaborative robots as a pseudo-human colleague working on construction sites together with humans.},

While off-the-shelf solutions are available for acoustically retrofitting existing learning spaces, they do not allow for a fine-tuned context-specific intervention. This possibility is however enabled through bespoke digital manufacturing informed by advanced digital simulations. In this research we explore and synchronize architecture, acoustics, computation and fabrication for the making of better sound environments. In this paper we present performance-driven design to manufacture workflows for sound scattering brick elements. We reimagine the brick as an acoustically-active geometry capable of modulating the sound experience in a university classroom, by improving speech intelligibility. We contextualize our research within existing methods of digital performance-based design and robotic fabrication processes, namely wire cutting and pick and place applications. We then detail digital methods that combine heuristics and acoustic simulation to design the bricks within the 3D modelling environment, as well as describe the processes of Robotic Oscillating Wire Cutting and Adaptive Pick and Place developed for the execution of the full-scale demonstrator. Finally, we report on the results of the acoustic analysis performed on the full-scale demonstrator in situ and laboratory measurements of a representative sample of demonstrator.},

  abstract = {Emerging from research in computational design and digital fabrication, the use of robot arms in architecture is now making its way in the practice of construction. However, their increasing diffusion has not yet corresponded to the development of shared approaches covering both digital (programming and simulation) and physical (end-effector design, system integration, IO communication) elements of robotic prototyping suited to the unique needs of architectural research. While parallel research streams defined various approaches to robotic programming and simulation, they all either (A) rely on custom combinations of software packages, or (B) are built on top of advanced robotic programming environments requiring a higher skill level in robotics than conventionally available in an architectural context. This paper proposes an alternative open-source toolkit enabling an intuitive approach to the orchestration of various hardware and software components required for robotic fabrication, including robot programming and simulation, end-effector design and actuation, and communication interfaces. The pipeline relies on three components: Robot Components, a plug-in for intuitive robot programming; Funken, a serial protocol toolkit for interactive prototyping with Arduino; and a flexible approach to end-effector design. The paper describes these components and demonstrates their use in a series of case studies, showing how they can be adapted to a variety of project typologies and user skills, while keeping highly complex and specific functionality available as an option, yielding good practices for a more intuitive translation from design to production.KeywordsRobotic fabricationHardware integrationOpen-source},

The most visible evidence of this has been the implementation of 3D printing technologies in the construction sector through the increasing availability of large scale systems. Inherent to the process is the ability to produce geometrically unconstrained, high resolution customised architecture. In this work, the authors present a concept in which 3D sand printing is coupled with casting high performance fibre reinforced concrete (HPFRC) to produce a composite material that can take advantage of the freedom afforded by 3D printing as well as the strength of HPFRC. A prototype slab element has been digitally designed and topologically optimised. The printed element consists of a 6 to 10 mm thin shell structure with internal voids that is then used as a stay in place formwork and infilled with a HPFRC to produce a final element that can be functional and more efficient structurally as well as aesthetically pleasing. Constraints discovered in the production of the prototype and the potential of this method to further produce custom architectural elements are discussed.},

  abstract = {Since the invention of Portland cement during the first industrial revolution, concrete has become an inseparable aspect of modern societies by being the predilection material used for the construction of the vast majority of housing and infrastructure. The recent development of concrete digital fabrication holds promises of a much more efficient way to build by granting access to free form geometrical complexity with appealing cost efficiency, reduced environmental footprint and increased worker safety. However, this transition to the digital era of concrete requires a greater mastery of this complex material which calls for a deeper and better understanding of its chemistry and microstructural behaviour. In this regard, the rheology of low water to cement ratio concretes and in particular the behaviour of superplasticisers in such systems remains difficult to predict and control, not only for digital fabrication, but much more broadly for concrete technology at large.  In this thesis, the impact of PCE superplasticisers on the nucleation and formation of hydrates in fresh model cement pastes was investigated by using cryo-FIB-SEM nano-tomography. Qualitative results showed that direct addition of PCE increases the dispersion as well as the amount of formed hydrates while reducing their size. However, this work faced insurmountable holdbacks with regard to the acquisition of unbiased tomographic quantitative data due to a recurring imaging issue budded “scaling artefact” and supposedly originating from the inhomogeneous nature of frozen cement pastes.   The second part of this PhD was dedicated to investigating the possible usage of thin digitally fabricated formworks in combination with low water to cement ratio fibre-reinforced concretes in order to produce topologically optimised elements. The approach chosen by this work was to avoid any advanced setting and hardening controls of the concrete in opposition to other techniques of digital casting. Two structurally viable elements were produced over two collaborative projects with the dbt research group (D-ARCH, ETH Zürich). The production of these elements led to the development and usage of several HPFRC formulations that were meeting the specific rheology and mechanical requirements of the projects.   The first produced element was a celling/flooring panel cast in a sand binder-jetting 3D printed lost formwork. The second element was a fully functional concrete canoe, the load bearing skeletal structure of which was 3D printed as a sub-millimetric formwork by FDM. Cast using a specially developed technique called “counter-pressure casting” to counteract the mechanical fragility of the formwork, the “skelETHon” canoe successfully participated in the 2017 Concrete Canoe Regatta wining the first prise of Design Innovation Awards.   These two demonstrators showed the great potential of 3D printing thin formworks for complex concrete elements highlighting the “complexity for free” promise made by concrete Digital Fabrication in general. Importantly it has served to define a new digital fabrication process with concrete, defined as counter-pressure casting that presents many advantages for a possible adoption by industry.  In summary, this thesis relates the importance of a better understanding of concrete chemical and microstructural aspects that are unconditionally needed for any advanced macro-application, including but not limited to concrete digital fabrication.},

Much is known about sound absorption, but little about sound scattering, although it is equally important for improving the acoustic quality of built spaces. This paper presents an alternative workflow for the computational design and evaluation of acoustic diffusion panels, which have been developed and realized in a real building project - the Immersive Design Lab (IDL). This workflow includes a computational design system, which is integrated with a rough acoustic evaluation method for fast performance feedback, as well as the assessment of acoustic performance with an experimental measurement setup, and the post-processing of a selected design instance for fabricability. The paper illustrates and discusses this workflow on the basis of the presented design study.},

Using computational design, surface structures are iteratively generated and 3D printed at 1:10 model scale. They originate from different fabrication typologies and are designed to have acoustic diffusion and absorption effects. An automated robotic process measures the impulse responses of these surfaces by positioning a microphone and a speaker at multiple locations. The collected data serves two purposes: first, as an exploratory catalogue of different spatio-temporal-acoustic scenarios and second, as data set for predicting the acoustic response of digitally designed surface geometries using machine learning. In this paper, we present the automated data acquisition setup, the data processing and the computational generation of diffusive surface structures. We describe first results of comparative studies of measured surface panels and conclude with steps of future research.},

  doi = {10.3929/ethz-b-000266031},
  abstract = {The development and dissemination of computer-aided modelling tools in the last two decades have enabled architects to design with complex, often double curved, geometry. In order to convert these digital data sets into the physical reality, digital fabrication technology has become crucial and, in turn, has stimulated the field of architectural geometry. However, commonly used digital fabrication methods are still time- and material-inefficient in producing bespoke double curved surfaces, generating the need for alternative solutions.  This thesis develops around a multi-robotic hot-wire cutting technique, that allows to significantly expand the set of possible hot-wire cutting geometries. In contrast to standard computer-controlled hot-wire cutting processes, in which the cutting medium remains straight, this technique modulates the curvature of the hot-wire, which adopts itself against the resistance of the processed material. This allows to produce a particular family of double-curved surface geometries: sweep surfaces defined by the motion of an altering profile curve along two guide curves. While the technique's principle is simple, its implications comprise to momentarily react and adapt to occurring forces, which dynamic change determine the overall form being cut. The aim of this thesis is to develop methods and techniques that allow to control this cutting technique and to foresee its outcome. Knowledge is acquired directly from the physical form-finding process and implemented in a respective digital model. The thesis investigates material- and fabrication process-related constraints, correlations between operating physical factors, such as heat input, cutting speeds, resulting cutting forces and wire shape. It develops and validates suitable design, simulation and fabrication techniques and examines possible architectural applications, such as the time-efficient production of formwork components at full architectural scale. The work is built upon the hypothesis that the integration of digital design and simulation techniques with adaptive control strategies can not only lead to efficient manufacturing procedures, but can also yield unique formal vocabularies in placing materiality as an a priori agent in the formulation of architectural building elements. As such, the thesis investigates topics that are generally relevant for digital fabrication processes with complex or non-linear behaviour and contributes to fabrication-aware design methods at large.},

Being pursued by the group of Gramazio Kohler Research at ETH Zurich, this approach involves a spatially coordinated movement of two sixaxis robotic arms that control the curvature of a hot-wire, which adopts itself against the resistance of the processed material (e.g. polystyrene). In contrast to standard CNC hot-wire cutting processes, in which the cutting medium remains linear, it allows the automated fabrication of non-ruled, doubly curved surfaces. This pursuit includes the development of a custom digital design and robotic control framework that combines computational simulation and manufacturing feedback information. Ultimately, SWC enables a considerably expanded design and fabrication space for complex architectural geometries and their construction through automated robotic technology. This paper addresses the applied workflow and technology 1) such as computational design and simulation, robotic control and adaptive fabrication, 2) results of application within a two-week design and building workshop, and 3) will conclude with further steps of future research.},

Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms are too slow to achieve performance on a real robot, but their potential has been demonstrated in simulated environments. We propose using progressive networks to bridge the reality gap and transfer learned policies from simulation to the real world. The progressive net approach is a general framework that enables reuse of everything from low-level visual features to high-level policies for transfer to new tasks, enabling a compositional, yet simple, approach to building complex skills. We present an early demonstration of this approach with a number of experiments in the domain of robot manipulation that focus on bridging the reality gap. Unlike other proposed approaches, our real-world experiments demonstrate successful task learning from raw visual input on a fully actuated robot manipulator. Moreover, rather than relying on model-based trajectory optimisation, the task learning is accomplished using only deep reinforcement learning and sparse rewards.},

Bamboo, rice husk, and coffee husk particles at 1.5 and 3\% percentages and a control treatment not using the particle were evaluated. The chemical properties, shrinkage, compaction, consistency limits, and grain size were characterized for the soil; and the anatomical, chemical, and physical properties for the lignocellulosic particles. The bricks were produced using an automatic press and characterized after the curing process for density, water absorption, porosity, loss of mass by immersion, compressive strength, durability, and thermal conductivity. The increase in the lignocellulosic waste percentage caused a mechanical strength decrease and bricks’ porosity and water absorption increase. However, it caused a decrease in density and an enhancement in loss of mass and thermal insulation properties. The bricks produced with rice husk obtained the best results in terms of mechanical and thermal properties, and were still among the best treatments for physical properties, standing out among the lignocellulosic waste as an alternative raw material source for soil–cement brick production.

Leads to the emerge of new methods of design that are more liberal and developing, as well as the emerge of new theories that control the sources of creativity of architects such as Parametric Designs, Algorithms Designs and other theories Modern. Because of this development process, the Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) has been used as an outlet for architects to implement and manufacture these infinite creativities, allowing them to construct vari-ous building elements such as cladding and structural elements in a digital manner using appropriate software and machines. The use of digital processing in architecture is a relatively recent phenome-non. As for the raise of modern programs and their expansion as well as the evolution of manufac-turing methods than ever before, Digital manufacturing comes to bridge the gap between design and implementation. Digital manufacturing used to produce and build fully complex Buildings. At this research we will deal with the strategies and processes for digital manufacturing, its uses, and final-ly the technologies and devices used in it. Also, we will deal with its importance in non-traditional projects and thus the impossibilities of implementing them in a traditional way. Showing that this process depends on computer -based system to allow digitally controlled translation of data from the design process to the manufacturing process, allowing the architect unlimited creative space that cannot be envisioned or manufactured in traditional ways. Thus, digital manufacturing became one of the most important possibilities that the architect had to arm to produce distinctive buildings.},

By describing two case studies, the paper sheds light on robotic fabrication process and timeline of the construction, as well as constraints related to architectural and structural requirements according to usage of different lightweight formworks and drone deposition techniques. The paper discusses the role of pneumatic and wooden formwork, since the replacement of conventional scaffolding by use of flexible formwork is very interesting research subject [6, 7 and 8], enabling additional savings regarding the material, cost and time necessary for the construction.

This move requires reconsidering serial production with crowdsourcing and user content in mind. The ideas presented will be explored through the design research developed within Plethora Project, a design practice that explores the use of video game interfaces as a mechanism for participation and user design. The research work presented throughout the book seeks to align with a larger project that is currently taking place in many different fields: The Construction of the Commons. By developing both the ideological and physical infrastructure, the project of the Commons has become an antidote to current economic practices that perpetuate inequality. The mechanisms of the production and governance of the Commons are discussed, inviting the reader to get involved and participate in the discussion. The current political and economic landscape calls for a re-formulation of our current economic practices and alternative value systems that challenge the current market monopoly"--},

Measurements from a monocular camera and an inertial measurement unit are probabilistically fused in a moving horizon estimator to obtain high accuracy estimates. Methods for detecting tracking loss and automatically resuming tracking are presented. The performance of the system is shown through experiments tracking various objects and ground truth measurements demonstrate the system’s ability to provide accurate realtime motion estimates. As an initial application of the system, a 100 brick structure with complex geometry was built by hand using the tracking system and an augmented reality visualizer to guide construction.},

As such, design of these structures should be based on cost rather than weight minimization. A review of papers on cost optimization of concrete structures published in archival journals is presented in this paper. These structures include beams, slabs, columns, frame structures, bridges, water tanks, folded plates, shear walls, pipes, and tensile members. Interesting and important results and conclusions are summarized. A review of reliability-based cost optimization is also included in the paper. It is concluded that there is a need to perform research on cost optimization of realistic three-dimensional structures, especially large structures with hundreds of members where optimization can result in substantial savings. The results of such research efforts will be of great value to practicing engineers. Additional research needs to be done on life-cycle cost optimization of structures where the life-cycle cost of the structure over its lifetime is minimized instead of its initial cost of construction only.},

  abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) printing is a branch of additive manufacturing (AM) that works by slicing a 3D computer-aided design (CAD) model into 2D layers and sequentially printing each layer additively until the entire object is obtained. There has been a growing interest in 3D printing in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry because of its ability to lower costs, reduce waste, and simplify the supply chain. Due to the inherent nature of this technology, it requires a synergistic effort among experts in different disciplines such as architecture, material science, structural design, and robotics, to name a few. Previous studies have focused on developing, exploring, and investigating the architectural, materials, and structural aspects. However, the robotic technology aspect received relatively less attention. Thus, the objective of this study is to critically review the existing 3D printing robotic systems in the AEC industry and explicitly categorize them. At first, the literature related to 3D printing robotic systems in the AEC industry was studied, and the subjects which have not been discussed extensively were identified. Then, the gaps in the existing state of the art were identified, and lastly, a classification method was developed and discussed. To obtain the classification of the existing construction 3D printing robotic systems, five parameters were highlighted, namely fabrication place, fabrication type, materials used, 3D printer type, and 3D printing technology. In addition, the obtained classification was based on exploring the combinations of these parameters and their variations for existing applications in the AEC industry. By selecting the material that will be used, the application type, and other structural details, the printer details will be provided based on the developed classifications. The resulting classification could greatly assist and guide stakeholders' efforts to better understand and adopt 3D printing in current and future projects.},

While new computer-aided methods are widely discussed and applied, their roots and relation to previous production technology remain obscure. The present work analyzes architecture from the perspective of production technology. It aims to contextualize contemporary research in the building industry—driven by information technology—and identify it as part of a continuous development in history of technology. The thesis is built around the scheme of a periodization model, which intends to integrate fabrication within manual, industrial and information technology. It is based on the relation between the three categories matter, energy, and information in each respective period. The validity of the model is proven with help of history of timber architecture, as no other construction method illustrates the relation between processing technology, fabrication methods and architecture more comprehensively over a comparable period of time. It will be studied whether the proposed model can be circumstantiated with historical facts—how constitutive changes in process technology influenced wood processing and how they respectively coined construction and appearance of timber architecture.},

Computer-numerically-controlled (CNC) milled foam moulds have been applied frequently in the last decades, resulting in good aesthetical performance. However, still the costs are high and a large volume of waste is produced. This paper describes the first outcomes of an R\&D project funded by STW, the Dutch Technology Foundation, that was executed in close cooperation with industry. The work aimed at offering a viable alternative technology for CNC-milling, reducing cost and material waste at the same time. By constructing a prototype of a flexible mould system, and evaluating its viability in the production environment of a concrete factory, conclusions could be drawn concerning its feasibility. The context for the R\&D project was a real ongoing project at the start of the research-a subway station in London-for which double-curved cladding elements needed to be produced. This paper discusses the principles of the technology, the construction of the prototype and the performance evaluation and accuracy. Some of the more fundamental technical aspects of the technology are discussed in a second paper in this ISOFF conference.},

Specifically, the research focuses on the integration of computational design, multi-objective optimisation and the development of novel approaches and techniques for large-scale 3D-printed module systems for low-embodied energy air ducts in the context of a pilot study for an open office environment. By investigating the interrelationship of polymer extrusion, material behaviour, computational design, computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation and multi-objective optimisation, the research leverages the capacities of each of these methods to create highly detailed geometries that are optimised for air diffusion to create locally differentiated thermal comfort. The paper contributes to and further extends existing research in the domain of large-scale 3D printing by presenting a series of developed novel approaches and techniques combining the diverse methods above to address the plural performance demands of low-embodied energy air-diffusion systems. It presents empirical research towards air simulation, geometry optimisation and bespoke fabrication for a high-quality, customised and resilient air-diffusion system to support the flexibility of contemporary office environments and reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities through increased resource-use efficiency and substantial waste and embodied energy reduction.},

  abstract = {We present a novel approach for incorporating collision avoidance into trajectory optimization as a method of solving robotic motion planning problems. At the core of our approach are (i) A sequential convex optimization procedure, which penalizes collisions with a hinge loss and increases the penalty coefficients in an outer loop as necessary. (ii) An efficient formulation of the no-collisions constraint that directly considers continuous-time safety and enables the algorithm to reliably solve motion planning problems, including problems involving thin and complex obstacles.},

  abstract = {A fast marching level set method is presented for monotonically advancing fronts, which leads to an extremely fast scheme for solving the Eikonal equation. Level set methods are numerical techniques for computing the position of propagating fronts. They rely on an initial value partial differential equation for a propagating level set function and use techniques borrowed from hyperbolic conservation laws. Topological changes, corner and cusp development, and accurate determination of geometric properties such as curvature and normal direction are naturally obtained in this setting. This paper describes a particular case of such methods for interfaces whose speed depends only on local position. The technique works by coupling work on entropy conditions for interface motion, the theory of viscosity solutions for Hamilton-Jacobi equations, and fast adaptive narrow band level set methods. The technique is applicable to a variety of problems, including shape-from-shading problems, lithographic development calculations in microchip manufacturing, and arrival time problems in control theory.},

  abstract = {This thesis presents work in the development of computational descriptions of Gehry's architectural forms. In Gehry's process for realizing buildings, computation serves as an intermediary agent for the integration of design intent with the geometric logics of fabrication and construction. This agenda for digital representation of both formal and operational intentions, in the context of an ongoing exploration of challenging geometries, has provided new roles for computation in architectural practice. The work described in this thesis focuses on the digital representation of surface geometry and its capacity for describing the constructibility of building enclosure systems. A particular class of paper surface forms - curved surfaces with minimal in plane deformation of the surface material - provide the specific object of inquiry for exploring the relationships between form, geometry and constructibility. An analysis and framework for the description of Gehry's geometry is developed through existing theory of differential geometry and topology. Geometric rules of constructibility associated with several enclosure system strategies are presented in this framework. With this theoretical framework in place, the discussion turns to efforts to develop generative strategies for the rationalization of surface forms into constructible configurations.},

The problem is formulated as a constraint-satisfying problem of tool configurations or, robot hand poses. Two types of robot motion are considered: discrete motion, or point to point motion, and continuous motion. Triangular facets are used to approximate the part surfaces. A pre-partition process decomposes the complex part surfaces into several simple, easy-to-solve patches. For each patch, robot hand poses are determined to satisfy certain task constraints. In this paper, the approach is applied to two applications: vision sensor planning and spray painting gun path planning. It is our belief that more robot planning applications in manufacturing can benefit from this method.},

  abstract = {Rammed earth(RE) is a low-tech recyclable building material with good heat storage and moisture absorption performance that can better maintain the stability of the indoor thermal environment and improve indoor comfort. With innovations in and the development of new technology, the field of rammed earth construction technology is gradually expanding. However, deficiencies in the thermal insulation of traditional rammed earth structures make it impossible for them to meet China’s building energy codes in cold regions. This study constructs a comprehensive evaluation index of the thermal performance of rammed earth walls that is based on the heat transfer mechanism, optimizing the thickness of the boundary conditions of the building interior’s design temperature, as well as the energy demand and economic efficiency. This research also offers a new design for the thermal insulation of rammed earth construction by combining the building energy savings design code with WUFI Pro software. This study demonstrates that the optimum thickness of rammed earth construction in Beijing is about 360 mm, the thickness of extruded polystyrene board (XPS) is 50 mm (for public buildings) and 70 mm (for residential buildings), and the structural form of external insulation offers the highest performance benefit. In addition, this work also evaluates the risk of condensation inside composite rammed earth construction, finding that there is a risk of condensation on the exterior side of the wall and at the interface between the insulation panels and rammed earth wall, thus requiring an additional moisture-proof layer. In this study, thermal mass and insulation are fully considered and a design strategy for rammed earth construction given quantitatively, providing a theoretical basis for the application of rammed earth materials in cold regions.},

Topology optimization is a wellestablished procedure within disciplines of aeronautic, automotive and naval engineering. However, while recent developments have highlighted a significant potential for structural innovation and reduction of material consumption in topologyoptimizing concrete structures, an effective method for large-scale manufacturing of such structures remains to be found. We argue that the prohibitive factor for large-scale adoption is the non-availability of mechanical processes capable of performing high-speed, high-volume manufacturing of advanced non-standard formwork and, consequently that this inhibition can be overcome through integrating ruled surface rationalization and robotically controlled abrasive wire cutting of three-dimensional formwork systems in polymerized styrene foams. The viability of the proposed method is demonstrated through the production of a 21 m spatial concrete structure, using abrasive wire cutting of EPS formwork via a containerized robotic work cell with an ABB IRB 6700 industrial manipulator, extended with external rotary axis.},

Through this, a direct chaining of optimization and robotic fabrication is established, in which optimization data is driving subsequent processes solving timber joint intersections, robotically controlling member prefabrication, and spatial robotic assembly of the optimized timber structures. The implication of this concept is studied through pilot fabrication and load-testing of a full scale prototype structure.},

From a geometric point of view, line-cutting brings a unique set of challenges in guaranteeing that the process is collision-free. In this work, given a set of cut-paths on a freeform geometry as the input, we propose a conservative algorithm for finding collision-free tangential cutting directions. These directions, if they exist, are guaranteed to be globally accessible for fabricating the geometry by line-cutting. We then demonstrate how this information can be used to generate globally collision-free cut-paths. We apply our algorithm to freeform models of varying complexity.},

  abstract = {Available throughout the world and used in construction for thousand years, earthen materials are known to improve indoor air quality while keeping the internal temperature relatively stable. In Rhône-Alpes, France, the rammed earth technic is the most spread and consists in compacting layers of earth, one by one, within a framework. Current thermal standards, which are mainly based on thermal resistance of the material, urge to insulate walls. However, due to its interaction with its environment, and its couplings between heat and moisture transfers, the observed thermal behavior of uninsulated rammed earth is commonly significantly above the expectations. The objective of the paper is to highlight the living comfort provided by non-insulated rammed earth walls, for different orientations, from in-situ measurements performed over more than two years. Winter, without or with low energy consumption for heating, and summer, with no cooling device, are studied. The study points out the important role of solar irradiance on the thermal balance of the house, and thus the importance of a good architecture.},

The combination of these materials is promising since it merges the sustainable and performative properties of first with the structural efficiency of the second one. The result is a materi- al system suited for customized prefabrication and easy on-site instal- lation. The current paper describes the design and fabrication process of the arch, which employed a single parametric design environment to bridge design and fabrication, and an innovative sequence of differ- ent robotic processes.

T-R programs are a class of programs that are also a specific form of k-decision lists, and are useful for programming tasks for autonomous agents. Using only the predicates of On, a test to see if one block is atop another, and Move, moving one block to another's column, genetic programming was able to evolve programs capable of stacking 4 blocks in a predefined order for as many as 500 different randomly generated fitness cases. Programs for 5 and 6 block situations were also successfully developed, but attempts to create programs satisfying the desireable regression property were largely unsuccessful. Rewarding programs based on performing the least number of moves after perfectly stacking blocks in all fitness cases also had limited success, yielding an individual likely generated by random chance and not by evolution.},

The primary noise sources which elicit the most fervent public resistance are road \& traffic noise, and commercial developments including the explosive trend in Big Box stores. Sound barrier walls have been one of the most common and effective abatement treatments for such applications. Due to the availability and relatively low cost, reflective materials like concrete, brick or block have been the traditional manufacturing components of sound walls. As the public’s knowledge of noise and noise treatments has evolved, however, so has its demand for more efficient sound wall performance. As a result, sound walls comprised of absorptive materials have grown in popularity amongst architects, developers, contractors and the general public. Thus there is an ongoing, vigorous discussion on the differences between absorptive and reflective sound walls, and which type is best suited for specific applications.},

  abstract = {Due to the growing concern of deforestation, renewable materials such as recycled cellulosic waste and non-wood fibres provide an alternative solution for partial replacement of wood resources as a reinforcement agent in building blocks. This study consists of exploring the feasibility of producing cellulose pulp and nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) from plants widespread in Tropical region; raffia fibre (Raphia vinifera), cassava bagasse (Manihot esculenta), ambarella (Spondias dulcis), and bamboo (Bambusa vulgaris); to assess their suitability as a source of reinforcing agent for composites. The recycling process of municipal waste fibres was also studied to promote the conservation of plant resources, as well as the circular economy. Bamboo organosolv pulp (BOP) and recycled waste carton pulp (RWCP) were used as a reinforcement phase in an earth-based matrix at varying fibre contents (0, 5, 7.5, and 10\%wt.) to assess their performances and durability for civil engineering construction applications. Fibres were produced using both organosolv and soda methods to assess the effect of processing on fibre properties. The composites were manufactured by the extrusion process and tested after 28 days. The results show that the inclusion of RWCP fibre in the soil matrix significantly improved the performance of the composites compared to matrices reinforced with BOP fibres. Addition of 5 \%wt. of RWCP, showed an improvement in flexural strength (56\%), specific energy (614\%), fracture toughness (57\%), wear resistance (48\%), and thermal insulation (21\%) compared to the control sample. The inclusion of RWCP in earth-based matrix increases the moisture loss, the drying shrinkage and behaves as a water reservoir for earth-based materials. It has been concluded from this study that RWCP has the potential to serve as a suitable reinforcement for the promotion of lightweight earthen wall block materials (reduction of bulk density up to 21\% after the inclusion of 10\% of RWCP), where flexural strength, ductility, and thermal insulation performance are the primary requirements. Besides, the successful replacement of virgin BOP fibres with RWCP fibres reduces the environmental footprint of the building material. Therefore, the use of this RWCP in the construction industry will be an attractive alternative as it will solve both energy and environmental concerns.},

We present a method, NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT), which outperforms the best fixed-topology method on a challenging benchmark reinforcement learning task. We claim that the increased efficiency is due to (1) employing a principled method of crossover of different topologies, (2) protecting structural innovation using speciation, and (3) incrementally growing from minimal structure. We test this claim through a series of ablation studies that demonstrate that each component is necessary to the system as a whole and to each other. What results is significantly faster learning. NEAT is also an important contribution to GAs because it shows how it is possible for evolution to both optimize and complexify solutions simultaneously, offering the possibility of evolving increasingly complex solutions over generations, and strengthening the analogy with biological evolution.},

  abstract = {A major challenge for evolutionary computation is to evolve phenotypes such as neural networks, sensory systems, or motor controllers at the same level of complexity as found in biological organisms. In order to meet this challenge, many researchers are proposing indirect encodings, that is, evolutionary mechanisms where the same genes are used multiple times in the process of building a phenotype. Such gene reuse allows compact representations of very complex phenotypes. Development is a natural choice for implementing indirect encodings, if only because nature itself uses this very process. Motivated by the development of embryos in nature, we define artificial embryogeny (AE) as the subdiscipline of evolutionary computation (EC) in which phenotypes undergo a developmental phase. An increasing number of AE systems are currently being developed, and a need has arisen for a principled approach to comparing and contrasting, and ultimately building, such systems. Thus, in this paper, we develop a principled taxonomy for AE. This taxonomy provides a unified context for long-term research in AE, so that implementation decisions can be compared and contrasted along known dimensions in the design space of embryogenic systems. It also allows predicting how the settings of various AE parameters affect the capacity to efficiently evolve complex phenotypes.},

  abstract = {Remotely sensed geospatial data are critical for applications including precision agriculture, urban planning, disaster monitoring and response, and climate change research, among others. Deep learning methods are particularly promising for modeling many remote sensing tasks given the success of deep neural networks in similar computer vision tasks and the sheer volume of remotely sensed imagery available. However, the variance in data collection methods and handling of geospatial metadata make the application of deep learning methodology to remotely sensed data nontrivial. For example, satellite imagery often includes additional spectral bands beyond red, green, and blue and must be joined to other geospatial data sources that can have differing coordinate systems, bounds, and resolutions. To help realize the potential of deep learning for remote sensing applications, we introduce TorchGeo, a Python library for integrating geospatial data into the PyTorch deep learning ecosystem. TorchGeo provides data loaders for a variety of benchmark datasets, composable datasets for generic geospatial data sources, samplers for geospatial data, and transforms that work with multispectral imagery. TorchGeo is also the first library to provide pre-trained models for multispectral satellite imagery (e.g. models that use all bands from the Sentinel 2 satellites), allowing for advances in transfer learning on downstream remote sensing tasks with limited labeled data. We use TorchGeo to create reproducible benchmark results on existing datasets and benchmark our proposed method for preprocessing geospatial imagery on-the-fly. TorchGeo is open-source and available on GitHub: https://github.com/microsoft/torchgeo.},

Constrained joint space planning is important for many real world problems involving redundant manipulators. On the one hand, tasks are designated in work space coordinates: rotating doors about fixed axes, sliding drawers along fixed trajectories or holding objects level during transport. On the other, joint space planning gives alternative paths that use redundant degrees of freedom to avoid obstacles or satisfy additional goals while performing a task. In simulation, we demonstrate that our methods are faster and significantly more invariant to problem/algorithm parameters than existing techniques.},

Acting on increasing digitalisation pressures, many national and international standards, protocols, and specifications have been generated with little conceptual framing or with no theoretical underpinning. This positioning paper responds to practical business needs of organisations and project teams, builds upon existing conceptual constructs, and delivers a modular information management framework. The Lifecycle Information Transformation and Exchange (LITE) framework is an extendable conceptual skeletal for defining, managing, and integrating project and asset information. Developed, described, and explained for ongoing field testing, the LITE framework integrates multiple components-information statuses, states, milestones, flows, gates, routes, loops, actions, sets, and tiers-which collectively lay the foundations for an open access digital platform being developed by an international Community of Research and Practice. The framework describes-and aims to predict-information flows across an asset's lifecycle. Its modular conceptual structure, iterative flows, and task-oriented terminology are calibrated to guide the integrated design, delivery, and utilisation of assets of any type, function, or scale.},

This novel technique clearly reveals its development towards construction application with various global achievements, including structures such as bridges, houses, office buildings, and emergency shelters. However, despite the enormous efforts of academia and industry in the recent past, the application of the 3DPC method is still challenging, as existing knowledge about its performance is limited. The construction industry and building sectors have a significant share of the total energy consumed globally, and building thermal efficiency has become one of the main driving forces within the industry. Hence, it is important to study the thermal energy performance of the structures developed using the innovative 3DPC technique. Thermal characterization of walls is fundamental for the assessment of the energy performance, and thermal insulation plays an important role in performance enhancements. Therefore, in this study, different wall configurations were examined, and the conclusions were drawn based on their relative energy performance. The thermal performance of 32 different 3DPC wall configurations with and without cavity insulation were traced using validated finite element models by measuring the thermal transmittance value (U-value). Our study found that the considered 3DPC cavity walls had a low energy performance, as the U-values did not satisfy the standard regulations. Thus, their performance was improved with cavity insulation. The simulation resulted in a minimum thermal transmittance value of 0.34 W/m 2 .K. Additionally, a suitable equation was proposed to find the U-values of 100 mm-thick cavity wall panels with different configurations. Furthermore, this study highlights the importance of analytical and experimental solutions as an outline for further research},

  abstract = {Mobile 3D Printing (M3DP), using printing-in-motion, is a powerful paradigm for automated construction. A mobile robot, equipped with its own power, materials and an arm-mounted extruder, simultaneously navigates and creates its environment. Such systems can be highly scalable, parallelizable and flexible. However, planning and controlling the motion of the arm and base at the same time is challenging and most deployments either avoid robot-base motion entirely or use human prescribed robot-base paths. In a previous paper, we developed a high-level planning algorithm to automate M3DP given a print task. The generated robot-base paths avoid collisions and maintain task reachability. In this paper, we extend this work to robot control. We develop and compare three different ways to integrate the long-duration planned path with a short horizon Model Predictive Controller. Experiments are carried out via a new M3DP system-Armstone. We evaluate and demonstrate our algorithm in a 250 m long multi-layer print which is about 5 times longer than any previous physical printing-in-motion system.},

In this paper we present a new fully autonomous path planning approach for mobile material deposition. We use a modified version of Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star (RRT*) algorithm, which is informed by a constrained Inverse Reachability Map (IRM) to ensure task consistency. Collision avoidance and end-effector reachability are respected in our approach. Our method also detects when a print path cannot be completed in a single execution. In this case it will decompose the path into several segments and reposition the base accordingly.},

In this paper, we present a system to automate this process by leveraging deep reinforcement learning techniques. Our system can learn quadruped locomotion from scratch using simple reward signals. In addition, users can provide an open loop reference to guide the learning process when more control over the learned gait is needed. The control policies are learned in a physics simulator and then deployed on real robots. In robotics, policies trained in simulation often do not transfer to the real world. We narrow this reality gap by improving the physics simulator and learning robust policies. We improve the simulation using system identification, developing an accurate actuator model and simulating latency. We learn robust controllers by randomizing the physical environments, adding perturbations and designing a compact observation space. We evaluate our system on two agile locomotion gaits: trotting and galloping. After learning in simulation, a quadruped robot can successfully perform both gaits in the real world.},

Therefore, the focus of the methodology is to facilitate architectural design processes through developing of customized computational design tools and workflows for data integration and concurrent performance evaluation. The research starts with the hypothesis that the technological advancements in digital design and fabrication can lead to re-exploration and improvement of traditional building techniques with local materials. The paper explains different stages of the methodology and the way the chained design to fabrication processes would lead to constructible, structurally possible and optimal design solutions of small scale and simple symmetric design solutions to complex topologies at the scale of larger complex buildings.},

  abstract = {The research is based on the Maltese archipelago, a collection of islands with no other building material available apart from Globigerina limestone. Importing materials before the industrial revolution was an impractical endeavour which led for the inhabitants of the island to learn and master ways how stone can be used in a variety of ways. This restriction resulted in a cultural landscape made out of one material, hence the material has not only transcended from a building resource to a building system but also became a predominant factor in the cultural identity of the island. Furthermore, stone’s natural and massive qualities arises the sense of firmness and timelessness, qualities which are rarely found in contemporary architecture. Alas, this building tradition is being replaced by modern industrialised materials and building techniques which depend on standardisation and require much less craftsmanship. The knowledge of this art and technique of cutting volumetric stones and assembling it into a building (stereotomy) is becoming less and less of a viable option, hence in risk of becoming stagnant and redundant. This study explores regionalism from a technologic and material point of view. It investigates the combination of traditional building techniques with current emerging technologies in digital fabrication with the goal to understand, reinterpret and also extend the performance of stereotomy as building technique through the use of computer aided craftsmanship. For this reason the starting points of this research were the material characteristics and craftsmanship considerations; more specifically, compression-only structural system and 6-axis industrial robotic arm with an abrasive diamond wire cutter. This ultimately strives for the preservation and contemporary reinterpretation of a cultural identity enrooted in the use of stone. The design case set prior to this research follows a similar trail of thought. The house for Maltese literature ‘s design intent is to give an architectural statement that would show an alternative to what post colonial Maltese society could identify themselves with. Both stone stereotomy and Maltese literature share the idea of transcendence from the mundane into the extraordinary; a narrative which was also the main driving force for the architectural gesture shown in the building’s morphology.},

A dual unit spherical Bézier-like curve corresponds to a ruled surface by using Study’s transference principle and closed ruled surfaces are determined via control points and also, integral invariants of these surfaces are investigated. Finally, the results are illustrated by several examples and the motion interpolation was shown as an embodiment of this method.},

This can be used for in-space manufacturing (ISM), facilitating the production of large functional structures in space which cannot fit within the payload fairing of a launcher system. In this paper, a new approach for a continuous fabrication process of structural elements is presented, combining the reach of a free-flying satellite and a robotic arm, utilizing a fused filament fabrication (FFF) 3D-printing setup. A motion planning algorithm was developed which calculates energy-efficient movement trajectories based on a truss design input combined with the movement constraints of the satellite and robotic arm. Using this printing paradigm, a long support-free truss was manufactured. This approach was further elevated by extending the truss structure along the second planar axis, thus facilitating the manufacture of structures larger than generally possible through a layer-by-layer approach. Subsequently, combining the segmented and continuous printing approach, a planar truss structure was produced.},

Em primeiro lugar, apresentaremos a noção de objectile de Deleuze e Cache em analogia à noção de algoritmo computacional, que incorpora a variabilidade e a singularidade na geração de sistemas paramétricos. Em segundo, dado que o objectile ocupa um contínuo por variação, proporemos três níveis de reflexão sobre a noção de objectile no contexto do projeto paramétrico de objetos de arte e design digitais. Em terceiro, investigaremos como a noção de topologia vista como um elemento primordial na geração da variabilidade e da singularidade – no âmbito dos sistemas paramétricos – pode instaurar um tipo distinto de produção, na vocação pelo customizável, executada com base em processos experimentais. Em quarto, examinaremos como os responsivos processos de simulação e fabricação digitais configuram-se como extensões protéticas das capacidades intelectivas e hápticas do indivíduo, trazendo à tona relações de retroalimentação entre o artesanal e o digital, o individual e o coletivo, a autografia e a alografia, o risco e a certeza.~Abstract In this article, we identify whether and how the methods of digital simulation and fabrication can dynamize the understanding of relations between art, design and crafts. We firstly present the concept of Deleuze and Cache of the~objectile~in analogy to the notion of computational algorithm, which incorporates variability and singularity in the generation of parametric systems. Secondly, since the~objectile~occupies a continuum through variation, we propose three levels of reflection on the idea of the~objectile~within the parametric design of art and design digital objects. Thirdly, we investigate how the notion of topology seen as a primordial element in the generation of variability and singularity - within the framework of parametric systems - can introduce a type of distinctive production through customization, carried out and based on experimental processes. Finally, we examine how the responsive processes of digital simulation and fabrication are configured as prosthetic extensions of the individual's intellectual and haptic capacities, producing feedback relationships between the artisanal and digital, the individual and collective, autography and alography, and risk and certainty.},

  abstract = {Visualisation of the scientific data is essential in analysing the results obtained from the fusion codes. The data, together with the mesh, is preferably stored in a standardised format. One step further is to use a common modelling grid description in which data from various fusion modelling codes, together with mesh, will be stored. In that sense, general grid description (GGD) is used as a format for storing data in the EUROfusion Integrated Modelling (EU-IM) database. OpenCASCADE CAD kernel is used to transform the CAD model into a triangular mesh for GGD storage in database. The ultimate goal of this work is to control the defeaturing of the CAD model applied to the desired level of detail (LOD) in order for it to be used as input for different meshing codes. In this paper, description is given of the grid generation using the open-source CAD-kernel Open CASCADE with the PythonOCC library. In addition, the process of storing the grid in GGD format will be explained. Finally, a ParaView plugin is shown for reading the data. The aim of the project presented in this paper is to automate the tedious task of CAD model defeaturing and meshing, which is often done manually, and to prepare it as a CAD service for use in scientific workflow engines in order to ensure data provenance.},

First, by being descriptive rather than prescriptive, evolutionary design runs the risk of evolving interesting yet unbuildable objects. Secondly, in a wide range of interesting and high-complexity design domains, such as dynamic and highly flexible objects, the gap between simulation and reality is too large to guarantee consilience between design and object. We suggest that one compelling alternative to evolutionary design in these complex domains is to avoid both simulation and description, and instead evolve artifacts directly in the real world. In this paper we introduce EvoFab: a fully embodied evolutionary fabricator, capable of producing novel objects (rather than virtual designs) in situ. EvoFab thereby opens the door to a wide range of incredibly exciting evolutionary design domains.},

In these three sections, we describe design and fabrication methodologies for both approaches and evaluate the potentials and limitations of both.

We investigate two different moments of implementation: linking performance to the generation of fabrication data (KnitCone) and integrating the ability to adapt fabrication data in realtime as response to fabrication processes (Neural-Network Steered Robotic Fabrication). Together they examine how models can employ design information as training data and be trained to by step processes within the digital chain. We detail the advantages and limitations of each experiment, we reflect on core questions and perspectives of ML for architectural fabrication: the nature of data to be used, the capacity of these algorithms to encode complexity and generalize results, their task-specificness versus their adaptability and the tradeoffs of using them with respect to conventional explicit analytical modelling.},

  abstract = {This paper positions the development and performance of a responsive acoustic envelope system, called Resonant Chamber, within significant discourses in ecology, systems theory and cybernetics. The project is developed through two dominant threads. First, the synthetic design process that entails engaging simultaneous computational and physical investigations which inform each other through various feedback and control regimes - from simulation and testing frameworks to material limits and behaviors to geometric, technological and manufacturing limitations or constraints. Second, the paper elaborates on the system's embedded sensing, communication, feedback and actuation system that transforms its performance to a kinetic, responsive environment that opens up possibilities for active acoustic control, as well as open-ended interaction and play with inhabitants. Within this paradigm, the designer operates through an adaptive mode, between control and the dynamic shaping of possibilities within digital, physical and effective logics, constraints and opportunities.},

  abstract = {Building and Construction have recently become an exciting application ground for robotics. In particular, rapid progress in materials formulation and in robotics technology has made robotic 3D Printing of concrete a promising technique for in-situ construction. Yet, scalability remains an important hurdle to widespread adoption: the printing systems (gantrybased or arm-based) are often much larger than the structure to be printed, hence cumbersome. Recently, a mobile printing system – a manipulator mounted on a mobile base – was proposed to alleviate this issue: such a system, by moving its base, can potentially print a structure larger than itself. However, the proposed system could only print while being stationary, imposing thereby a limit on the size of structures that can be printed in a single take. Here, we develop a system that implements the printing-while-moving paradigm, which enables printing single-piece structures of arbitrary sizes with a single robot. This development requires solving motion planning, localization, and motion control problems that are specific to mobile 3D Printing. We report our framework to address those problems, and demonstrate, for the first time, a printing-while-moving experiment, wherein a 210 cm × 45 cm × 10 cm concrete structure is printed by a robot arm that has a reach of 87 cm.},

Ecological technologies have been created for the food sector, waste conversion industries, architecture and landscape design, and to the field of environmental protection and restoration. The five case studies presented here represent applications of ecological design in five areas: sewage treatment, the restoration of a polluted body of water, the treatment of high strength industrial waste in lagoons, the integration of ecological systems with architecture, and an agriculturally based Eco-Park. Case \#1 is an Advanced Ecologically Engineered System (AEES) for the treatment of sewage in Vermont, a cold climate. The facility treated 300 m3 per day (79,250 gallons per day) of sewage to advanced or tertiary wastewater standards, including during the winter months. A number of commercial byproducts were developed as part of the treatment process. Case \#2 involved the treatment of a pond contaminated with 295 m3 per day (77,930 gallons per day) of toxic leachate from an adjacent landfill. A floating Restorer was built to treat the polluted pond. The Restorer was powered by wind and solar based energy sources. Over the past decade the pond has improved. There has been a positive oxygen regime throughout the water column, bottom sediments have been digested and the quality of the sediment chemistry has improved.},

  abstract = {Designers physically engage with a material to experience how certain characteristics allow the fabrication of unique expressions. In digital fabrication, however, this improvisational negotiation is typically replaced by a virtual simulation that predicts how a material expression can be fabricated, limiting the resulting design language to algorithmic forms. In contrast, we believe that digital fabrication can also produce ‘emergent’ material expressions that are so confounded that they appear slightly differently even when being produced by identical operations. This paper argues that such expressions can be executed by a domain-driven feedback paradigm, which integrates a human-in-the-loop to encode the tacit fabrication knowledge that is generated by reviewing intermediate outcomes. We encode this tacit knowledge by fabrication grammars, rule-based descriptions that causally relate fabrication parameters to qualitative descriptions of material expressions. By documenting a set of Single Point Incremental Forming experiments, this paper demonstrates how emergent material expressions can be controlled by semantically meaningful fabrication grammars, which even can be combined towards purposeful design goals. We believe our findings might allow the digital fabrication of material expressions that appear to have been produced manually or naturally; and support the future sharing of tacit fabrication knowledge.},

The research presented in this paper explores the possibilities of a timber-earth slab (T.E.S.) that can meet such high demands while being fully recyclable. T.E.S. comprises a hybrid structure, which aims to combine the strong tensile properties of wood with the beneficial properties of earth in terms of thermal mass, thermal activation capabilities, fire resistance, and sound insulation. It integrates a novel material technology capable of casting earth with low water content and combines it with robotic technology that enables the bespoke fabrication of a filigree wooden structure tailored to mechanically interlock with the earth infill. The proposed method makes it possible to place the earth infill in the lower part of the floor slab and thus expose it to the interior space, whereby its storage mass and component activation can be fully utilized. This paper presents the concept and design principles, initial findings on the system’s loadbearing behaviour, as well as the experimental validation of the novel fabrication process in 1:4 and 1:1-scale demonstrators, in which the general feasibility of the system in assessed. The paper finally discusses the proposed methods and results of the experiments and outlines further steps for transferring the system into building practice.},

  abstract = {We shed light on the disruptive advances brought by the ubiquity of computing and communication environments, which link devices and people in unprecedented ways into a new kind of techno–social systems and infrastructures recently named ‘cyber-physical ecosystems’ (CPE). While pointing to fundamental biases that prevent the traditional engineering school of thought from coping with the magnitude in scale and complexity of these new technological developments, we attempt to lay out the foundation for a new way of thinking about systems design, referred to as emergent engineering. One major characteristic of CPE is that, given their very nature, they cannot be a priori defined but rather emerge from the interactions among a myriad of elementary components. We show how this emergence can be guided by balancing positive and negative feedback, which tunes the growth of new configurations and adapts the system to sharp and unexpected changes. Rather than attempting to design the system as a whole, the components of the system are endowed with capabilities of dynamic self-assembly, disassembly and re-assembly to enable ‘evolve-ability’. As paradoxical as it may seem to the classically trained systems engineer, this new attitude of the designer as an ‘enabler’ (vs. ‘dictator’ of a system’s blueprint) allows the system to seamlessly adapt its development and evolve to meet dynamic goals and unexpected situations in an anticipative manner – an impossible feat under the traditional approach. To the extent that it produces new functionality, the proposed method enables a system to evolve via its ability of pervasive adaptation. Emergent engineering lies at a boundary where theoretical discovery meets systems engineering, computing and communications into a new convergent science of complex systems design. It currently transforms systems and software engineering by embracing various highly interdisciplinary perspectives.},

In its first section, the social dimension of the structure of architectural knowledge is addressed, which is not regarded as a feature particular to this field of practical knowledge, but something that can be studied in almost every complex field of such knowledge. In the second section, the focus lies on the central figure of the field of architectural knowledge, namely the architect. Special attention is paid to the development of the scope of his tasks during the Renaissance and to a trend towards specialization among architects. Finally, aspects of the mathematical knowledge of Renaissance architects are the topic of the third and last section. In particular, the knowledge structure of geometrical procedures that were employed and developed by architects over centuries and that cannot be regarded as applications of learned (Euclidean) geometry will be discussed; rather, these procedures eventually constituted the starting point of a new sub-discipline of learned geometry: descriptive geometry.},

Those consist in a compacted earth wall (using “Tapial-technic”) of 55 m length with three cutwaters. Three different construction methodologies were detected in the wall-dike: monolithic-wall (s. XI), royal wall (s. XII-XIII) and contemporary reparation (s. XIX). These elements were conserved in the original position with the help of the micropiles technique. The consolidation stages were as follows: vertical micropiles in its perimeter; horizontals micropiles in the base of the wall; brace beam and thought bolts with Gewi rod. After the digging, also, laminated metal sections with an “L” were welded together and to vertical micropiles. That element is fully integrated with both underground construction and its environment, “Paseo del Violón”.},

  abstract = {The Belgian architect Jacques Gillet designed the sculpture house in Liège (1967-1968) as a synthesis of structure and form, collaborating on this project with the sculptor Félix Roulin and the engineer René Greisch. This ‘livingsculpture’ was undertaken by the team as a reaction against the general pressure of that time towards standardisation of forms in architecture, in which an artistic poverty and deficiency needed to be counterbalanced through collaboration with sculptors and painters. The merit of the artistic collaboration is evident when looking at the scheme of the building yard. The materials and techniques used gave the team a creative liberty: steel bars were folded, and placed one by one, to enhance the contingency between nature, space, material and poetry. A metal mesh was affixed to the steel bars and the ultimate form was then secured by projecting a fast setting concrete onto it: direct, immediate and efficient. The exterior is just the mere envelope of the interior; no additional structure whatsoever was necessary. The structure was left bare on the outside, postulating a true unity between form and material.},

  abstract = {When designing construction objects, different disciplines have to collaborate intensively. Each discipline is responsible for its own contribution to the overall design. However, when the partial designs are combined, objects from different disciplines might occupy the same position in space or 'clash'. Such a clash will often be noticed during the construction process requiring a lot of extra time and cost. Using 3D visualization, it is possible to combine the partial designs of all partners and find the clashing objects visually in an early stage. However, when the complexity of a construction project increases, a clash easily stays unnoticed. Besides, much more time is needed for inspecting a complex design. Therefore, an algorithm to discover clashes will be more reliable and efficient. Clash detection techniques are already available in 3D graphics (referred to as 'collision detection'). There are a great number of methods described on the internet on how to perform this collision detection. All these methods are based on describing objects in terms of 3D shapes, but do not take into account the structure/hierarchy of objects that is common in construction projects. In the AEC industry, the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) open standard holds this structure next to the 3D shape of building objects. By using the IFC standard to perform clash detection on construction models, the structure of objects can be utilized, resulting in a much higher performance. This paper will demonstrate how to combine the best collision detection methods with the structure provided by IFC, making clash detection fast enough to be used inside a real time environment like a server. This clash detection is currently implemented in the IFC Engine viewer developed by TNO, and works on models opened from their open-source BIMserver (Building Information Model) where the collaboration starts. The next step would be integrating the clash detection inside the server. © 2018 Esprit. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {For the past few decades there has been a growing concern about the environmental implications associated with the use of soil fertilizers. In Europe, over 90\% of fertilizer is distributed using spinning disc spreaders. The popularity of spinning disc spreaders lies with their relative low cost. However, the performance of these machines is highly dependent on the particle properties (e.g. friction coefficients, shape). This results in large differences in spread patterns depending on the fertilizer type as well as the prevailing weather conditions (e.g. air humidity). This dependence requires extensive experimental calibration of the spreader for each type of fertilizer. When a new spreader is designed this calibration work has to be largely repeated. DEM is believed to be the key to increase the understanding of the spreading process, the design of better spreaders and a drastic reduction of experimental calibration.},

  abstract = {We present an investigation into the relation between design principles in Japanese gardens, and their associated perceptual effects. This leads to the realization that a set of design principles described in a Japanese gardening text by Shingen (1466), shows many parallels to the visual effects of perceptual grouping, studied by the Gestalt school of psychology. Guidelines for composition of rock clusters closely relate to perception of visual figure. Garden design elements are arranged into patterns that simplify figure-ground segmentation, while seemingly balancing the visual salience of subparts and the global arrangement. Visual ‘ground’ is analyzed via medial axis transformation (MAT), often associated with shape perception in humans. MAT analysis reveals implicit structure in the visual ground of a quintessential rock garden design. The MAT structure enables formal comparison of structure of figure and ground. They share some aesthetic qualities, with interesting differences. Both contain naturalistic asymmetric, self-similar, branching structures. While the branching pattern of the ground converges towards the viewer, that of the figure converges in the opposite direction.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a critical analysis and reflection on stereotomy with the purpose of updating its theoretical discourse. Having risen to the apex of architecture technological possibilities in the 17th century, stereotomic construction lost its importance in favour of iron, steel and other materials and construction techniques brought by the Industrial Revolution. More recently, much owing to the possibilities offered by digital technologies, a resurgence of interest in the subject has spawned various researches which bring stereotomy back to the architectural discourse. Although technological applications and design innovations in service of stereotomy have developed in multiple interesting paths, there is a lack of a common theory on the subject which is capable of relating these multiple apparently diverging stereotomic approaches between each other and, maybe even more importantly, to the classical practice which sparked the development this discipline. The research presented in this paper shows how the digital tools were instrumental in bringing this tradition to architecture contemporaneity and how a current stereotomy is largely supported by these technologies, while keeping strong relations to its classic origin.},

  abstract = {Stereotomy is usually regarded as a classic discipline in the field of architecture which has lost its relevance to other construction methods. Recently we have witnessed approaches to the stereotomic way of building using modern digital technologies, bringing the discipline to the present. On the other hand, the complex shaped buildings being built in the present seem to lack some kind of structure visible in classic stone architectures. A shift in construction methods must be attended to, with its metallic beams and concrete massifs. For an understanding of what remains the same and what changes from the classic literature, this paper tries to create analogies between contemporary architecture surfaces and the discrete stone structures of the past. To achieve this, a concept of stereotomy semantics is introduced, creating a different posture towards the problem of division of surface in architecture.},

This workflow will ultimately allow for the construction of customized, free-form, on-site concrete structures without the need for complex formwork. The paper starts with an explanation of the relevance of collaborative robotics through history in the industry and in architecture. An argument is put forward for the need to move towards the development of collaborative processes based on feedback loops amongst the designer, the robot and the material, where they all inform each other continuously. This kind of process, with different degrees of autonomy and agency for each actor, is necessary for on-site deployment of robots. A test scenario is described using an innovative material named concrete canvas that exhibits hybrid soft fabric and rigid thin-shell tectonics. This research project illustrates the benefits of integrating information-embedded materials, mass-customization and feedback loops. Geometry scanning, parametric perforation pattern control, computational analysis and simulation, and robotic fabrication were integrated within a digital fabrication deployment scenario. The paper concludes with a detailed report of research findings and an outline for future work.},

At its peak in the nineteenth century, by pushing the structure and construction limits, it gained the ability of using ``the weight of the stone against itself by making it hover in space through the very weight that should make it fall down'' (Perrault 1964, cited Etelin, 2012). The modern architectural tectonics, based on structural comprehension in architecture, found no value in stereotomy beyond its early, Gothic period. Similarly, digital architectural theory recognized in Gothic the early examples of a material systems. This paper reassesses stereotomy at its fundamental levels, as a material system based on generative processes that assimilate structure and construction through parameterization. In this way, a theoretical framework is established that exposes stereotomy's intrinsic potentials: the continuity of historic and contemporary examples, overlaps between current research endeavours, and its genuine relevance for contemporary digital architecture.},

  abstract = {Knowledge-Based Engineering (KBE) is a research field that studies methodologies and technologies for capture and re-use of product and process engineering knowledge. The objective of KBE is to reduce time and cost of product development, which is primarily achieved through automation of repetitive design tasks while capturing, retaining and re-using design knowledge. Published research on KBE is not very extensive and also quite dispersed; this paper is an effort to collect and review existing literature on KBE. A total of 50 research contributions have been analysed. The main objectives of this analysis are to identify the theoretical foundations of KBE and to identify research issues within KBE, pointing out the challenges and pitfalls that currently prohibit a wider adoption of KBE while suggesting avenues for further research. Key findings include (a) the necessity for improved methodological support and adherence, (b) better transparency and traceability of knowledge, (c) the necessity for a quantitative framework to assess the viability and success of KBE development and implementation projects, and (d) the opportunity to move towards mass customization approaches through distributed deployment of KBE in the extended enterprise.},

  abstract = {Cement manufacturing industry is one of the carbon dioxide emitting sources besides deforestation and burning of fossil fuels. The global warming is caused by the emission of green house gases, such as CO2, to the atmosphere. Among the greenhouse gases,CO2 contributes about 65\% of global warming. The global cement industry contributes about 7\% of greenhouse gas emission to the earth’s atmosphere. In order to address environmental effects associated with cement manufacturing, there is a need to develop alternative binders to make concrete. Consequently extensive research is on going into the use of cement replacements, using many waste materials and industrial by products. Efforts have been made in the concrete industry to use waste glass as partial replacement of coarse or fine aggregates and cement. In this study, finely powdered waste glasses are used as a partial replacement of cement in concrete and compared it with conventional concrete. This work examines the possibility of using Glass powder as a partial replacement of cement for new concrete. Glass powder was partially replaced as 10\%, 20\%, 30\% and 40\% and tested for its compressive, Tensile and flexural strength up to 60 days of age and were compared with those of conventional concrete; from the results obtained , it is found that glass powder can be used as cement replacement material upto particle size less than 75µm to prevent alkali silica reaction.},

The results demonstrated that an increase in the activator ratio as well as that of curing time favors mechanical strength in the material. Nevertheless, with 90day of curing time and 80°C or a greater curing temperature, have a negative effect on strength. Through characterization by X-ray diffraction a slight shift along with an increase in the amorphous halo between 20° and 30° (2θ) was observed and is characteristic of geopolymers. SEM–EDS analysis indicated the presence of Na and an increase in the Si/Al ratio from 8 to 11.5 with the incorporation of activators. The results indicate that the use of alkali and silicate activators on non commercial zeolite could be use in the synthesis of geopolymers.},

In the era of 3D-printing, GENDE can pave the way to a completely new class of mass products in which personalization become intrinsic to the design process and is driven by common users rather than being confined in the later stages of production and in the hands of professional designers.

  abstract = {Utilization of in Situ resources is a fundamental capability to be developed for the construction of permanent and semi-permanent structures on Mars and the Moon. Nevertheless, direct human contact with regolith would jeopardize crew health. New design strategies that address such problems need to be explored and developed. This paper presents a feasible design for a hybrid class 2 / class 3 outpost that includes ISRU structures integrated with prefabricated inflatable and solid elements, both for pressurized and infrastructure elements. The Architectural Design Thesis Laboratory of the Polytechnic University of Bari conducted research on this topic, and, under the name of archi.mars, the group designed a permanent and self-sufficient settlement: "HiveMars". The proposal explores a concept for the integration of ISRU-enabled and prefabricated structures to create a scalable infrastructure capable of supporting human life on the surface. To reduce mission costs and launch load from Earth, eight different automated rovers will prepare the site area before the crew's arrival. Following the site exploration phase (identified in the Hellas Planitia, in the martian southern hemisphere) the automated surface assets will proceed with the material collection, processing, and construction of the main infrastructures, including Landing pads and roads. The first habitat nucleus is composed of three self-supporting, interconnected domes, built with Martian regolith using additive manufacturing, and outfitted with an inflatable, pressurized core that hosts the pre-integrated ECLSS systems and the internal infrastructure. A pre-integrated dome on the top of the prefabricated core ensures the right amount of natural light while protecting the internal habitat from radiations and micro-meteoroid impacts.},

  abstract = {With 3D printing, material consumption can be reduced: It allows to place material only where needed, therefore structurally optimized building parts or formworks can be printed. Currently this technique uses an epoxy based resin to glue layer by layer an inert sand bed. However, this material choice holds a large improvement potential from an environmental and health perspective. It was shown previously, that the organic glue, that releases unhealthy volatile organic compounds, can be replaced by a mineralic binder, namely a geopolymer. With geopolymers and alkali activated materials, the embodied energy can be reduced, especially when built from waste materials. In this study, we focus on the replacement of the sand, which is becoming a scarce resource. The waste from a local gneiss quarry in Ticino (Switzerland) could be a good alternative. The powder bed of the 3D printing is made of aggregates of crushed quarry waste mixed with an aluminosilicate powder. The printing liquid is an alkaline solution that activates the aluminosilicate and reacts to a geopolymer. Droplet penetration experiments on different powder mixes were performed to adjust the binder composition. With a custom built powder bed 3D printer, samples with varying compositions and porosities were printed and tested on compression. It could be shown that samples printed with quarry waste perform as well as samples printed with silica sand in terms of compression strength and accuracy. This new material system is promising: with 3D printing of geopolymers and quarry waste, we can combine the environmental benefits of a new building technique with a low carbon intense material. The application of this technique may help the sustainable development of the local quarry sector by consuming the volumes of waste that causes storing and ecological issues and keep small quarries running.},

  abstract = {Not long ago, many historians believed that the first great era of German modern architecture ended abruptly with Hitler’s rise to power. According to this narrative, the demise coincided with the closure of the Bauhaus in 1933 and the subsequent emigration of leading architects such asWalterGropius and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. Today, we know that the story is far more complicated. On the one hand, historians such as Barbara Miller Lane and Winfried Nerdinger have shown that the Nazis’ views of modernism were more nuanced than was once believed, and that many German modernist designers courted and were granted government patronage under the Nazi regime. On the other hand, we still know little about the transnational architectural networks that sustained the Nazis during World War II. A case in point is the professional relationship between the Finnish architect Alvar Aalto and the German industrial builder Ernst Neufert, who worked for Albert Speer from 1938 to 1945. In Alvar Aalto, Ernst Neufert, and Architectural Standardization in Germany and Finland, 1933–45, Nader Vossoughian examines the history and genesis of that relationship, particularly its relevance to wartime debates about standardization.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new approach to robotic fabrication in the building industry through the conceptualization, development and evaluation of a largescale, transportable and flexible robotic timber construction platform – named TIM. Novel solutions are necessary to make robotic fabrication technologies more accessible for timber construction companies. The developed robotic system is location independent and reconfigurable. It can be rapidly integrated into existing fabrication environments of typical carpentries on a per-project basis. This allows the exploitation of emerging synergies between conventional craft and specialized automation technologies and benefits both quality and productivity of the trade. We portrait how the platform enabled the effective robotic prefabrication of a complex segmented wood shell structure and discuss the fabrication system based on critical performance parameters. Further research is needed to disentangle the mutual dependencies of building-systems and respective automation technologies.},

The objective of this approach is to efficiently and economically fabricate forms for casting, such as concrete or metals which can be easily post-processed and finished. Our perspective is informed by the appreciation of the difficulties in achieving high-quality finish in viscous/granulate material extrusion, such as clay or concrete, for architectural parts that need to achieve a wide range of resolutions without significant and often laborious post-processing. We thus employ clay as an abundant, low-cost, environmentally friendly material for mold making that can be both easily post-processed if required and disposed or recycled.},

According to basic hypotheses and simplifications, the mathematical model of the prototype warp deformation is constructed, and each of the influencing factors concretely, including the deposition layers number n, the stacking section length L, the chamber temperature Te, and the material linear shrinkage rate α, is quantificationally analyzed. Based on the analysis results, some issues and phenomena in the FDM process are rationally explained.

A system of coded rules that defines the boundaries, shapes incentives and distributes rights among such autonomous agents. To lay a foundation for engineered ownership, we first study the nature of ownership by examining the concept of property. Shaped by history and ideologies, property rights are the most formalized and studied ownership system. We then untangle the layered structures and system design impacts of property by investigating three property rights theories. Finally, we derive from these learnings the system features of engineered ownership, identify related challenges, and present a roadmap towards a holistic theory of engineered ownership.},

  abstract = {A method for erecting structures composed of rammed-earth. A method of rammed-earth building construction is disclosed wherein walls are post-tensioned to enhance the ability of the wall to receive lateral loading without failing in tension.     Post-tensioning rods are anchored to a concrete footing, and temporary forms erected alongside the footing. A protective sleeve is disposed around each post-tensioning rod. An earthen mixture is placed between the forms and around the sleeves, and rammed by compaction in a series of stacked courses. When the rammed-earth wall has obtained the desired height, it is topped with a concrete bond beam through which the post-tensioning rods extend. Using the bond beam as a brace against which a retaining plate may push, retaining plates are disposed upon the bond beam and around the threaded upper ends of each rod. A nut is threaded upon each rod and tightened against the retaining plate to draw the rod into tension. The torque applied to the nut thus loads the wall in compression via the plates and bond beam. Thus compressed, the rammed-earth wall is less susceptible to tension failure.},

Our approach extends RRT*, which was introduced for holonomic robots [10], by using a fixed-final-state-free-final-time controller that optimally connects any pair of states, where the cost function is expressed as a trade-off between the duration of a trajectory and the expended control effort. Our approach generalizes earlier work on RRT* for kinodynamic systems, as it guarantees asymptotic optimality for any system with controllable linear dynamics, in state spaces of any dimension. In addition, we show that for the rich subclass of systems with a nilpotent dynamics matrix, closed-form solutions for optimal trajectories can be derived, which keeps the computational overhead of our algorithm compared to traditional RRT* at a minimum. We demonstrate the potential of our approach by computing asymptotically optimal trajectories in three challenging motion planning scenarios: (i) a planar robot with a 4-D state space and double integrator dynamics, (ii) an aerial vehicle with a 10-D state space and linearized quadrotor dynamics, and (iii) a car-like robot with a 5-D state space and non-linear dynamics.},

The Surrealist process of the Exquisite Corpse, where a group of artists work collectively on a single drawing, without seeing the work of their collaborators, Salvador Dalí called working in “semi-darkness”. This method succeeds however in producing complex combinations of forms that rarely emerge from solo designers. When a project arose for a vault in a remote environment, the Exquisite Corpse was chosen to generate complimentary and juxtaposing forms from which an architectural language could be later assembled. A model of the vault was fabricated using a robotic arm with a custom built nichrome wire foam cutting end effector from 107 billets of expanded polystyrene. The discussion notes the stereotomic challenges, the differences between the modelled outcome and its stone version, and reflects on maintaining “semi-darkness” during early stages of form design.},

A new design method and a computational tool for generating valid architectural topological interlocking geometries are discussed. In the heart of the method are an algorithm for automatically generating valid two-dimensional patterns and a set of procedures for creating several types of volumetric blocks based on the two-dimensional patterns. Additionally, the computational tool can convert custom sets of closed planar curves into structural elements based on the topological interlocking principle. The method is examined in a case study of a building floor. The article concludes with discussions on the potential advantages of using the method for architectural design, as well as on challenging aspects of further development of this method toward implementation in practice.},

  abstract = {Social insects build large, complex structures, which emerge through the collective actions of many simple agents acting with no centralized control or preplanning. These natural systems motivate investigating the use of artificial swarms to automate construction or fabrication. The goal is to be able to take an unspecified number of simple robots and a supply of building material, give the system a high-level specification for any arbitrary structure desired, and have a guarantee that it will produce that structure without further intervention. In this thesis I describe such a distributed system for automating construction, in which autonomous mobile robots collectively build user-specified structures from square building blocks. The approach preserves many desirable features of the natural systems, such as considerable parallelism and robustness to factors like robot loss and variable order or timing of actions. Further, unlike insect colonies, it can build particular desired structures according to a high-level design provided by the user. Robots in this system act without explicit communication or cooperation, instead using the partially completed structure to coordinate their actions.},

These structures can (1) exactly match arbitrary user-specified designs, (2) adapt their shape to immovable obstacles, or (3) form a wall of given minimum width around an environmental feature. These three possibilities span the range from entirely prespecified structures to those whose shape is entirely determined by the environment. Robots require no explicit communication, instead using information storage capabilities of environmental elements (a form of “extended stigmergy”) to coordinate their activities. We provide theoretical proof of the correctness of the algorithms for the first two types of structures, and experimental support for algorithms for the third.},

  abstract = {Building large and stable structures from highly irregular stones is among the most challenging construction tasks with excavators. In this paper, we present a method for grasp planning and object manipulation that enables the world’s first autonomous assembly of a large-scale stone wall with an unmanned hydraulic excavator system. Our method utilizes point clouds and mesh surface reconstruction of stones in order to plan grasp configurations with a 2-jaw gripper mounted on the excavator. Besides considering the geometry of the stone to sample force closure grasps, the grasp planner also takes into account collision constraints during object pick and place, informed by a LiDAR based point cloud map. Furthermore, we show an approach to reorient arbitrarily shaped objects that are not feasible to be directly placed at the desired location without violating collision constraints. Using a physics engine, we find a settled intermediate pose that allows direct placement and is reachable from the initial stone pose. The applicability of the proposed grasp planning method is demonstrated with the construction of a dry stone wall composed of over one hundred boulders using an autonomous excavator. We show a high primary grasp success rate (82.2 \%) and illustrate how the system recovers from slippage by relocating the object and re-planning the grasp correspondingly.},

We developed a method for dry-stacking unprocessed rock. We implemented an algorithm to produce 3D printed parts that connect digitized stones in the plane normal to the thrust line. A manually designed input curve is recalculated according to the weights of the objects to generate a compression-only arch. We employed evolutionary optimization to calculate optimal orientation of digitized stones along the thrust-line. Different stone arrangements and 3D printed connectors were tested. The manual assembly is done using a mixed reality setup. Unprocessed or rubble rock is a massive resource of cheap building material with very low embodied energy that might see a revival through digital technologies.},

Recent proposals for the robotic fabrication of construction components include examples of techniques for cutting ruled surface geometries through the pairing of an industrial robot arm with a linear blade. While these demonstrate the fabrication of curved and complex geometry, they do not resolve many technical issues around speed, accuracy and material finish, critical to a robust process demanded by the manufacturing industry. To address these, the research presented here pursued a detailed investigation into of the history of bandsaw cutting technology. Key knowledge of material crafts and obsolete applications of ruled geometries both offer significant insights. Using these in an iterative development, a rapidly improved robotic design and fabrication process is demonstrated here.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new method for cost-effective realization of topology optimized structures using robotic abrasive wire-cutting of expanded polystyrene formwork. Topology optimization has shown potential for generating material efficient designs and increasing performance in architectural structures. However, the method results in complex, structural morphologies which frustrate efficient construction of said structures. To overcome this, and make the realization of the potential of topology optimization feasible in general construction, new approaches are needed. We propose an integrated method of ruled surface rationalization and robotically controlled abrasive wire-cutting of formwork parts in Expanded Polystyrene. The method is demonstrated through robotic production of EPS formwork using a pilot abrasive wire-cutting endeffector on a containerized robotic work cell with an ABB IRB 6700 industrial manipulator, extended with external rotary axis. The usability of the formwork is demonstrated through the construction of a 21 m, prefabricated demonstrator structure using Ultra High Performance Concrete.},

In this paper, we present a method to generate bone-like porous structures as lightweight infill for additive manufacturing. Our method builds upon and extends voxel-wise topology optimization. In particular, for the purpose of generating sparse yet stable structures distributed in the interior of a given shape, we propose upper bounds on the localized material volume in the proximity of each voxel in the design domain. We then aggregate the local per-voxel constraints by their p-norm into an equivalent global constraint, in order to facilitate an efficient optimization process. Implemented on a high-resolution topology optimization framework, our results demonstrate mechanically optimized, detailed porous structures which mimic those found in nature. We further show variants of the optimized structures subject to different design specifications, and we analyze the optimality and robustness of the obtained structures.},

  abstract = {Additively manufactured parts are often composed of two sub-structures, a solid shell forming their exterior and a porous infill occupying the interior. To account for this feature this paper presents a novel method for generating simultaneously optimized shell and infill in the context of minimum compliance topology optimization. Our method builds upon two recently developed approaches that extend density-based topology optimization: A coating approach to obtain an optimized shell that is filled uniformly with a prescribed porous base material, and an infill approach which generates optimized, non-uniform infill within a prescribed shell. To evolve the shell and infill concurrently, our formulation assigns two sets of design variables: One set defines the base and the coating, while the other set defines the infill structures. The resulting intermediate density distributions are unified by a material interpolation model into a physical density field, upon which the compliance is minimized. Enhanced by an adapted robust formulation for controlling the minimum length scale of the base, our method generates optimized shell-infill composites suitable for additive manufacturing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on numerical examples, and analyze the influence of different design specifications.},

However, the material efficiency is offset by the traditional use of scaffolds to position materials and counter the out of equilibrium forces during assembly. We introduce a method of sequentially assembling compression only structures without a scaffold by robotically maintaining the compression equilibrium in every step. A two-arm collaborative robotic setup was used to maintain force equilibrium throughout arch assembly with the arms taking turns first hot wire cutting and placing blocks and providing a temporary scaffold to support the arch end point. To test the approach, a single catenary arch was generated using form-finding techniques and sequentially built from foam blocks. Moving forward we show the relationship between the joint valence (largest number of joined branches) of a multi-branched structure and the minimum number of robotic arms required for assembly using our initial technique. With only two robotic arms available, the technique was further developed to reduce the required number of arms per arch branch from two to one by attaching caterpillar tracks at the block supporting end effector. This allows a human to load the next block and the arm to move forward along the arch while maintaining equilibrium. Results show that robotic equilibrium scaffold free arch assembly is possible and can reduce scaffold waste and maintain the material efficiency of compression only structures. Future work will explore further applications of assistive robotics in construction replacing static construction aids with dynamic sensory feedback of equilibrium forces.},

  abstract = {The objective of this article is to present a novel design and fabrication strategy for a particular concrete construction system that reduces mass and increases geometric flexibility. The system can be applied for mid-scale buildings with classic DomIno concrete skeletons. As one of the most used construction materials, concrete has excellent properties for not only load-bearing but also generating almost any complicated geometry. However, the normal construction method usually results in a high CO2 emission which is mainly caused by the large amount of formwork. In order to decrease the formworks, simple geometries are mostly fabricated in conventical construction, such as slabs that contain numerous structurally unnecessary materials. To improve these issues, a parametric design method is described, focusing on efficiently placing the concrete where it is structurally required. For the fabrication part, an innovative technology called Shotcrete Three-dimensional Printing (SC3DP) is introduced subsequently to avoid any formwork during the construction and reduce the manpower to a maximum limit. For fast and precise fabrication, the modular elements are printed flat on the ground. After that, corresponding subtractive post-processing strategies of concrete in the green state were developed for connecting the modular building components into a whole structure. The whole design and fabrication methodology was recently developed and applied by one group of students from ITE at TU-Braunschweig for a digital concrete fabrication competition, as a verification large-scale demonstration. Finally, an outlook based on current results is provided for future research extension, which will lead this strategy into a more precise and on-site process.},

Part of the evolving set is presented to a user as a shape gallery to offer modeling suggestions. User preferences define the fitness for the evolution so that over time, the shape population will mainly consist of individuals with good fitness. However, to inspire the user’s creativity, we must also keep the evolving set diverse. Hence the evolution is “fit and diverse”, drawing motivation from evolution theory. We introduce a novel part crossover operator which works at the finer-level part structures of the shapes, leading to significant variations and thus increased diversity in the evolved shape structures. Diversity is also achieved by explicitly compromising the fitness scores on a portion of the evolving population. We demonstrate the effectiveness of set evolution on man-made shapes. We show that selecting only models with high fitness leads to an elite population with low diversity. By keeping the population fit and diverse, the evolution can generate inspiring, and sometimes unexpected, shapes.},

The original contribution of this workflow is the usage of a shape memory alloy (SMA) as a cutting wire, that enables the production of curved forms. The workflow was tested on the production of a Gyroid-like modular system to reveal its advantages and limits. Several attempts were made to find the most accurate approximation of the Gyroid. The result suggested that NL-RHC would be an efficient solution for the production of curved surfaces if the SMA is trained and the robot path is calculated correctly},

  abstract = {Healthy buildings meet their users’ biological, psychological and sociological needs by presenting a healthy living environment. As being a very important environmental problem, noise negatively affects user health by causing a wide variety of health problems, even leading to mortality. In order to prevent noise induced health problems, buildings should be designed to have the quality of reducing environmental noise levels to acceptable levels. Therefore, material selection of building elements is one of the most important issues to be considered during design. Unfired clay materials such as adobe (mudbricks/blocks), rammed earth, alker (gypsum adobe) are ecologically friendly building products. Moreover, they are very healthy because of their excellent characteristics such as relative humidity and temperature stabilization of indoor environment, condensation inhibition, odor absorption, fire resistance as well as electromagnetic shielding. In this study, acoustic performance of unfired clay materials has been researched within the scope of noise reduction. In this context, the transmission of air-borne sound from unfired clay products and the absorption behavior of those products against noise increase due to reflection has been examined. Therefore, sound transmission loss of wall sections obtained from unfired clay products has been compared with basic building materials such as fired clay -solid, hollowed-, concrete, stone, glass, gypsum. Consequently, the positive performance of the unfired clay material against noise in terms of sound transmission loss has been revealed and various suggestions have been made for sound absorption behavior. Increasing the use of unfired clay products will contribute to preventing the negative effects of noise on human health.},

Adaptations of Dijkstra’s and A* algorithms are introduced that compute the approximate cost-to-go function over a simplicial complex embedded in the free space. Interpolation methods are carefully designed and analyzed so that they are proven to converge numerically to the optimal cost-to-go function. As the result, the computed function produces approximately optimal trajectories. The methods are implemented and demonstrated on 2D and 3D examples. As expected, the simplicial A* algorithm significantly improves performance over the simplicial Dijkstra’s algorithm.},

  abstract = {Evolution and development (Evo-Devo), are the two main processes which produce all of the different kinds of phenotypes we see in nature. Evolutionary process is responsible for eliminating the genetic information of weak phenotypes through natural selection, and also for exploring novel genotypes through genetic operations; crossover, mutation. The development process is the process of using the set of rules (codons) written in a genome, to turn a single set (zygote) into a mature phenotype. In this thesis, evolutionary and developmental processes are used to evolve the configurations of three-dimensional structures in silico to achieve desired performances. Although natural systems utilize the combination of both evolution and development processes to produce remarkable performance and diversity, this approach has not yet been applied extensively to the design of continuous three-dimensional load-supporting structures. Beginning with a single artificial cell containing information analogous to a DNA sequence, a structure is grown according to the rules encoded in the sequence. Each artificial cell in the structure contains the same sequence of growth and development rules, and each artificial cell is an element in a finite element mesh representing the structure of the mature individual. Rule sequences are evolved over many generations through selection and survival of individuals in a population.},

Initial evidence of these attributes is present in the phenotypes that are developed from the artificial evolution, although neither characteristic is imposed nor selected-for directly. The computational evolutionary development approach presented here shows promise for synthesizing novel configurations of high-performance systems. The approach may advance the system design to a new paradigm, where current design strategies have difficulty producing useful solutions.},

Our method, which mimics fundamental processes from biology, enables individuals to reach maturity in a controlled process through a stochastic environment. Three different mechanisms were implemented; disease mechanisms, gene suppression, and thermodynamic balancing. This approach was integrated as part of a structural evolutionary model. The model evolved continuum3-D structures which support an external load. By using these mechanisms we were able to evolve individuals that reached a fixed size limit through the growth process. The growth process was an integral part of the complete development process. The size of the individuals was determined purely by the evolutionary process where different individuals matured to different sizes. Individuals which evolved with these characteristics have been found to be very robust for supporting a wide range of external loads.},

In this paper, we present practical and efficient algorithms to construct iso-contours, bisectors and Voronoi diagrams of point sites on M, based on an exact geodesic metric. Compared to Euclidean metric spaces, the Voronoi diagrams on M exhibit many special properties that fail all the existing Euclidean Voronoi algorithms. To provide practical algorithms for constructing geodesic-metric-based Voronoi diagrams on M, this paper studies the analytic structure of iso-contours, bisectors and Voronoi diagrams on M. After a necessary preprocessing of model M, practical algorithms are proposed for quickly obtaining full information about iso-contours, bisectors and Voronoi diagrams on M. The complexity of the construction algorithms is also analyzed. Finally three interesting applications, surface sampling and reconstruction, 3D skeleton extraction and point pattern analysis are presented that show the potential power of the proposed algorithms in pattern analysis.},

Based on the intrinsic geometry of the surface, the resulting Reeb graph is pose independent and captures the global profile of surface geometry. Our algorithm is very efficient and it only takes several seconds to compute on neuroanatomical structures such as the cingulate gyrus and corpus callosum. In our experiments, we show that the Reeb graphs serve well as an approximate skeleton with consistent topology while following the main body of conventional skeletons quite accurately.},

This paper presents a feasible concrete printing process, where cement-based filament is extruded onto aggregates bed to form layer-by-layer structures. Distinct from extrusion-based concrete printing, coarse aggregates are incorporated in the printing process and serve as the supporting material. A prototype printer has been successfully developed and aggregate content could reach about 40\% in the printed concrete. Furthermore, the printed structures gained compressive strength up to 48.9~MPa and flexural strength up to 7.5~MPa at 28~days, which satisfies the general engineering requirement. Besides, an apparent mechanical anisotropy was found in printed structures and the reason of this anisotropy is the voids formed around aggregate layers and the weak interfacial transition zone located between aggregate and paste.},

In this work, computational simulations are performed to understand some mechanical responses in stabilized-sludge masonry elements with different geometries and to compare the simulation results with common materials in the literature. Simulation outcomes showed that hollow-block geometry saves up a considerable amount of material and improves stress distribution compared with a solid block. Also, the mechanical simulation of the stabilized-sludge elastic zone achieved a better performance than a compressed earth block, which is a similar material used in construction. This way, the design of more sustainable elements through an innovative methodology based on statistics, mathematical and computational models, saving materials, time, and energy is sought, generating an economic and environmental impact.},

  abstract = {Modern earth buildings constructed of Compressed Earth Blocks (CEBs) are of low-cost, energy efficient, and sustainable. Environmental regulations are suggested for zero emission of greenhouse gases. The strength of CEBs is usually enhanced with the addition of 5 to 10\% of cement whose manufacturing may be harmful to the environment. A novel composite of soil (i.e., clay, sand, and jute fiber) is used to produce CEBs without addition of cement. The jute fiber was added by weight from 0.5 to 2\% to a mixture of pulverized clay, sand, and water. The CEBs were tested for compressive strength, tensile strength in terms of modulus of rupture, load vs deflection response, shrinkage, drying time, and development of cracks. With the addition of jute fiber, (i) the compressive strength, deflection, drying time, shrinkage, and cracks were reduced, (ii) the modulus of rupture slightly increased, and (iii) the load at failure was almost same. The addition of 0.5\% of jute fiber was enough to minimize the drying cracks. The CEBs were reinforced with jute fiber dried in about half the time taken by those without fiber. The average compressive strength, tensile strength, and linear shrinkage of the CEBs are within acceptable limits prescribed by available guidelines. This paper shows that the CEBs manufactured using clay, sand, and jute fiber could be used for construction of earth buildings instead of those stabilized with cement.},

Despite a plentiful source of raw material, cultural anchorage, and low carbon footprint, the use of rammed earth in new building projects is severely constrained by contemporary building codes and norms which have been developed around industrial building products, to the detriment of natural building materials. In particular, stringent seismic regulations have rendered monolithic earth masonry difficult to justify structurally.

  abstract = {The vernacular architecture of the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region in southeast France is dominated by unstabilized rammed earth buildings. Despite a plentiful source of raw material, cultural anchorage, and low carbon footprint, the use of rammed earth in new building projects is severely constrained by contemporary building codes and norms which have been developed around industrial building products, to the detriment of natural building materials. In particular, stringent seismic regulations have rendered monolithic earth masonry difficult to justify structurally. The Maison Pour Tous design/build project identifies and demonstrates a replicable path for new rammed earth buildings within the existing regulatory framework. While cost remains a challenge, the successful realization of the Maison Pour Tous illustrates that rammed earth is no longer relegated to the region's past.},

  abstract = {Il s’agit d’une recherche en architecture portant sur l’intégration de la mécatronique dans la conception des chantiers de construction. La mécatronique est une démarche de conception par combinaison des techniques électroniques informatiques et mécaniques. On retrouve la mécatronique dans des objets du quotidien, mais surtout comme outil de production dans l’industrie avec la robotique. La recherche sur la « mécatronique de construction » existe depuis les années 70 à l’initiative du secteur de la construction au Japon. En architecture la « mécatronique de conception » a permis l’émergence de nouvelles pratiques autour de la fabrication. Celles-ci sont apparues dans les années 2000, grâce à l’accès aux machines à commandes numériques et aux microcontrôleurs dans le milieu académique.Ces objets de recherche et ces nouvelles pratiques sont difficilement observables dans l’industrie de la construction. La mécatronique semble relativement absente des chantiers et la robotique de construction ne fait pas encore partie des catalogues d’engins de construction. La mécatronique de conception ne fait pas encore partie des outils des bureaux d’études. Nous avons donc cherché à connaitre les processus de conception des systèmes mécatroniques pour la construction. Pour cela nous avons confronté la mécatronique aux processus de conception des chantiers d’une entreprise générale de construction.Nous avons réalisé une série d’expériences sous forme de cas d’étude en observation participante. Ces cas d’étude concernent la production de concepts de mécatronique de construction associés à la mise au point des chantiers. Nous avons mobilisé les acteurs de la conception des chantiers (bureaux d’étude, services d’ingénierie technique, conducteurs de travaux) pour travailler sur différents aspects de la mécatronique adaptée à leurs métiers.Cette connaissance de la conception doit nécessairement s’appuyer sur un socle scientifique. L’architecture n’étant pas une discipline scientifique, nous nous sommes appuyés sur des théories de la conception telles que l’Architecturologie développée au sein du laboratoire MAACC. Celles-ci nous ont servi de grille de lecture pour nos observations et de support pour proposer des méthodes de conception de la mécatronique de construction.},

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing methods1–4 using static and mobile robots are being developed for both on-site construction5–8 and off-site prefabrication9,10. Here we introduce a method of additive manufacturing, referred to as aerial additive manufacturing (Aerial-AM), that utilizes a team of aerial robots inspired by natural builders11 such as wasps who use collective building methods12,13. We present a scalable multi-robot three-dimensional (3D) printing and path-planning framework that enables robot tasks and population size to be adapted to variations in print geometry throughout a building mission. The multi-robot manufacturing framework allows for autonomous three-dimensional printing under human supervision, real-time assessment of printed geometry and robot behavioural adaptation. To validate autonomous Aerial-AM based on the framework, we develop BuilDrones for depositing materials during flight and ScanDrones for measuring the print quality, and integrate a generic real-time model-predictive-control scheme with the Aerial-AM robots. In addition, we integrate a dynamically self-aligning delta manipulator with the BuilDrone to further improve the manufacturing accuracy to five millimetres for printing geometry with precise trajectory requirements, and develop four cementitious–polymeric composite mixtures suitable for continuous material deposition. We demonstrate proof-of-concept prints including a cylinder 2.05\,metres high consisting of 72 layers of a rapid-curing insulation foam material and a cylinder 0.18\,metres high consisting of 28 layers of structural pseudoplastic cementitious material, a light-trail virtual print of a dome-like geometry, and multi-robot simulations. Aerial-AM allows manufacturing in-flight and offers future possibilities for building in unbounded, at-height or hard-to-access locations.},

  abstract = {In this paper we are reporting on a prototypical implementation of a model view checker for model instance validation of Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) models. This checker is developed based on the open standards mvdXML as the format for structuring validation rules and the BIM Collaboration Format (BCF) to issue reports as a result of the checking process. The checker is implemented on top of the open source bimserver.org framework. The research presented here has two main aims: (1) to develop an open source IFC validation tool based on flexible and standardized method; (2) to identify issues and capabilities of the current mvdXML rules based on real-world scenarios and to develop stable and easy-to-use IFC validation methods using open standards. Two BIM operational standards required by local building regulations and laws, the Dutch Rgd BIM Norm, and the Norwegian Statsbygg BIM Manual are used to validate both the mvdXML standardsÕ capabilities and the tools implementation. The rules from these standards are categorized into different rule types and converted to mvdXML templates and rules. These rules are then tested using a prototypical, open source software tool. By combining this tool with a BCF server we demonstrate the deployment of such automated checking procedures in real working processes. Based on these experiences, a detailed discussion about identified issues is provided as the starting point for the future research and a feedback to standardization organizations.},

The development of mutual trust depends on immutable, traceable, and transparent construction quality information records. However, current information technologies cannot meet the requirements. To address the challenge, this study explores a blockchain-based framework for construction quality information management, which extends applications of blockchain in the domain of construction quality management. A consortium blockchain system is designed to support construction quality management in which participants’ information permissions and lifecycle are discussed. Additionally, this study presents in detail the consensus process that aims to address the problem of information fraud. The automated compliance checking based on smart contracts is presented as well, aiming to assure that construction products meet regulation requirements. Finally, an example of the consortium blockchain network is visualized to validate the feasibility of blockchain-based construction quality information management. The research shows that blockchain can facilitate mutual trust in construction quality management by providing distributed, encrypted, and secure information records and supporting automated compliance checking of construction quality.},

  abstract = {A multiobjective optimization problem involves several conflicting objectives and has a set of Pareto optimal solutions. By evolving a population of solutions, multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are able to approximate the Pareto optimal set in a single run. MOEAs have attracted a lot of research effort during the last 20 years, and they are still one of the hottest research areas in the field of evolutionary computation. This paper surveys the development of MOEAs primarily during the last eight years. It covers algorithmic frameworks such as decomposition-based MOEAs (MOEA/Ds), memetic MOEAs, coevolutionary MOEAs, selection and offspring reproduction operators, MOEAs with specific search methods, MOEAs for multimodal problems, constraint handling and MOEAs, computationally expensive multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs), dynamic MOPs, noisy MOPs, combinatorial and discrete MOPs, benchmark problems, performance indicators, and applications. In addition, some future research issues are also presented.},

  abstract = {Popular high-dimensional motion planning algorithms seem to pay an overly high price in terms of trajectory quality for their performance. In domains sparsely populated by obstacles, the heuristics used by sampling-based planners to navigate narrow passages can be needlessly complex; furthermore, additional post-processing is required to remove the jerky or extraneous motions from the paths that such planners generate. In this paper, we present CHOMP, a novel method for continuous path refinement that uses covariant gradient techniques to improve the quality of sampled trajectories. Our optimization technique converges over a wider range of input paths and is able to optimize higher- order dynamics of trajectories than previous path optimization strategies. As a result, CHOMP can be used as a standalone motion planner in many real-world planning queries. The effectiveness of our proposed method is demonstrated in manipulation planning for a 6-DOF robotic arm as well as in trajectory generation for a walking quadruped robot.},
